feat: SpeakSharp v1.0 - Privacy-first real-time speech coaching platform

## Overview

SpeakSharp is an AI-powered speech coaching SaaS that helps professionals
improve public speaking through real-time feedback on filler words, speaking
pace, and vocal clarity.

## Development Arc (1,625 commits)

### Phase 0: MVP Foundation (PR #153-165)
- Core application features and MVP UI
- Fixed blank screen and microphone bugs
- Migrated from Jest to Vitest for test stability
- Established documentation-first workflow (PRD, ARCHITECTURE, ROADMAP)

### Phase 1: Stabilize & Harden (PR #166-300)
- Session duration limits and tier enforcement
- AI-powered suggestions feature
- Custom vocabulary for Pro users
- Codebase restructuring (frontend/, backend/, tests/)
- CI/CD pipeline with Playwright sharding

### Phase 2: User Validation & Polish (PR #301-600)
- Speaking pace (WPM) analysis
- Clarity score visualization
- Goal setting (daily/weekly targets)
- Lighthouse CI integration (Performance 100%)
- WebSocket reconnect with exponential backoff
- Session comparison and progress tracking

### Phase 2.5: UI/UX Premium Polish
- CVA-based design system with elegant shadows
- Premium skeleton loading states
- Mobile sticky controls
- Gamification (practice streaks)

### Phase 3: Integration Safety (PR #601-800)
- Schema canary tests for API drift detection
- Stripe billing with webhook idempotency
- Independent code reviews (2 external audits)
- Coverage expansion (56% → 75% target)

### Phase 4: Launch Hardening (PR #801-1625)
- Soak testing (concurrent user simulation)
- Canary smoke tests against staging
- fetchWithRetry for resilient profile loading
- MSW-to-Playwright routes migration
- Toast notification deduplication

## Core Value Proposition

- **Privacy-First Design**: On-device transcription via Whisper (speech never
  leaves the browser) for users who cannot risk sensitive conversations
  going to the cloud

- **Real-Time Feedback**: Instant filler word detection (um, uh, like, you know),
  words-per-minute analysis, and clarity scoring as you speak

- **Accessible & Affordable**: Web-based (no app install), freemium model with
  generous free tier (30 min/month), more affordable than Poised

## Architecture

### Frontend (React + Vite)
- TypeScript-first with strict type safety
- Zustand for global state management
- CVA-based design system with premium dark theme
- Lighthouse: Performance 100%, Accessibility 95%, Best Practices 100%

### Backend (Supabase + Edge Functions)
- PostgreSQL with Row Level Security
- Deno-based Edge Functions
- Stripe integration for subscriptions

### Speech-to-Text Engines (3 modes)
├── On-Device (Whisper): Privacy-first, WebAssembly, cached via SW
├── Cloud AI (AssemblyAI): High-accuracy professional transcription
└── Native Browser: Zero-cost fallback using Web Speech API

### Testing Infrastructure
- 406 unit tests with Vitest (57% coverage)
- 38 E2E tests with Playwright (4-shard parallel)
- Canary smoke tests against production staging
- Soak tests for 10 concurrent users
- Lighthouse CI for performance regression

## Key Features

### Must-Have (All Implemented)
- [x] Real-time transcription (3 STT modes)
- [x] Filler word detection & counting
- [x] Speaking pace (WPM) analysis
- [x] Clarity score with trend visualization

## Security & Reliability

- Stripe webhook idempotency (replay attack protection)
- Exponential backoff for transient failures (1s → 30s)
- Service Worker caching for offline model access
- CORS hardening with ALLOWED_ORIGIN validation
- Processed webhook event deduplication table

## Documentation

- ARCHITECTURE.md: Complete system design (1,800 lines)

- ROADMAP.md: Development phases and tech debt
- CHANGELOG.md: Version history

## Known Limitations (Alpha Acceptable)

- Light theme not implemented (dark theme only)
- Filler word detection uses regex (NLP upgrade planned for beta)
- Supabase security hardening blocked (requires Pro account)
