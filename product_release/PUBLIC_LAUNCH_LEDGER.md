# Public Launch Ledger

**Last updated:** 2026-05-14
**Current public-launch decision:** NO-GO
**Controlled desktop tester decision:** GO WITH LIMITATIONS, tracked separately in `product_release/RELEASE_DECISION.md`

This ledger is the source of truth for broad public launch gates. It must not be mixed with the controlled desktop tester burn-down.

## Gate Ledger

| ID | Gate | Severity | Why It Blocks Public Launch | Evidence Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---:|---|
| PL-001 | Public signup + first-user onboarding | P0 | A public user must be able to enter without admin-created accounts. | Brand-new user signs up through public UI, reaches Session, logs out/in, and recovers state. | PASS | `/private/tmp/speaksharp-pl001-public-signup-1778802961686/report.json`; public `/signup` alias fixed in commit `994d06a1` |
| PL-002 | First useful Basic session | P0/P1 | New users need immediate product value. | Public user completes Native Browser session with transcript/save/history/detail/analytics, or receives clear browser/mic guidance. | PASS | `/private/tmp/speaksharp-pl002-basic-useful-session-1778803561321/report.json` |
| PL-003 | Production Stripe checkout | P0 | Public Pro purchase cannot rely on admin provisioning or test mode. | Basic user starts production checkout from public UI and completes real payment. | OPEN | Not started |
| PL-004 | Production Stripe webhook entitlement | P0 | Paid users must become Pro without manual intervention. | Production webhook verifies signature, updates entitlement, persists after refresh/logout/login. | OPEN | Not started |
| PL-005 | Billing failure/cancel/downgrade lifecycle | P0 | Stale Pro access or wrong downgrade is trust/billing risk. | Canceled, failed, duplicate, and replayed payment states keep entitlement correct. | OPEN | Not started |
| PL-006 | Promo redemption/reuse/expiry | P0/P1 | Launch includes promos, so promo entitlement must be safe. | Public promo apply succeeds once, reuse/invalid/expired codes fail clearly, expiry downgrades correctly. | OPEN | Not started |
| PL-007 | Real-mic Pro Cloud | P1 | Cloud is marketed as a Pro feature. | Real human speech in normal Chrome produces Cloud transcript -> save -> history/detail/analytics. | OPEN | Not started |
| PL-008 | Pro AI feedback | P1 | AI is a launch promise. | Saved session generates useful AI feedback; provider failures degrade gracefully. | OPEN | Not started |
| PL-009 | Pro PDF export | P1 | PDF is a launch promise. | Exported PDF is parsed/inspected for transcript, metrics, branding, and engine metadata. | OPEN | Not started |
| PL-010 | Mobile baseline | P1 | Public traffic will include mobile users. | Auth, nav, Session controls, transcript, fillers, status/toasts work on mobile viewport/device. | OPEN | Not started |
| PL-011 | Observability/support loop | P1 | Public failures must be visible and triageable. | Frontend, Edge, provider, auth, billing, and tester feedback signals are distinguishable. | OPEN | Not started |

## Phase Plan

| Phase | Gates Included | Exit Criteria | Status |
|---|---|---|---:|
| Phase 1: Public entry | PL-001, PL-002 | A brand-new public Basic user can sign up, complete first useful session, and return after logout/login. | PASS |
| Phase 2: Paid entitlement | PL-003, PL-004, PL-005 | A real production payment creates durable Pro entitlement; cancel/failure/downgrade paths are safe. | OPEN |
| Phase 3: Promo lifecycle | PL-006 | Public promo behavior is safe for redeem, reuse, expiry, and downgrade. | OPEN |
| Phase 4: Pro product promises | PL-007, PL-008, PL-009 | Cloud, AI, and PDF each pass with provider/live artifact evidence. | OPEN |
| Phase 5: Launch coverage | PL-010, PL-011 | Mobile baseline and observability/support are sufficient for uncontrolled public users. | OPEN |

## Latest Evidence

| PL-002 | public-signup | Chrome CDP 9222 | manual-chrome-cdp; synthetic system speech attempted via macOS `say`; not manual-real-mic | PASS | `/private/tmp/speaksharp-pl002-basic-useful-session-1778803561321/report.json` |

## Next Gate

| Gate | Why Next | Required Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| PL-003 Production Stripe checkout | Production payment is the next public-launch P0 after public entry is proven. | Basic user starts production checkout from public UI and completes real payment without admin provisioning or Stripe test-mode proof. |
