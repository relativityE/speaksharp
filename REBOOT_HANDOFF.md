This document summarizes the project's state before a VM reboot, intended to resolve a critical environment issue.

### 1. Current Status & Task

*   **Current Task:** The primary goal was to resolve E2E test failures.
*   **Progress Made:**
    *   A server-crashing bug in the Tailwind CSS configuration was diagnosed and fixed.
    *   The network stubbing logic in `tests/sdkStubs.ts` was hardened to prevent deadlocks and unhandled requests.
    *   The entire E2E test suite (`free`, `anon`, `pro`, `auth`) was refactored for robustness, maintainability, and improved logging.
    *   All project documentation (`PRD.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`) has been updated to reflect the current state.
*   **Critical Blocker:** The sandbox environment is unstable and prevents E2E tests from running. Any test involving the application's authentication logic hangs indefinitely without producing logs, even after all application-level bugs have been fixed. This points to a fundamental incompatibility between the test runner (Playwright) and the execution environment.

### 2. Key Changes to Preserve

The following files have been modified and their changes are critical to preserve across the reboot:

*   `tests/free.e2e.spec.ts` (refactored)
*   `tests/anon.e2e.spec.ts` (refactored)
*   `tests/pro.e2e.spec.ts` (refactored)
*   `tests/auth.e2e.spec.ts` (refactored)
*   `tests/sdkStubs.ts` (hardened)
*   `src/index.css` (Tailwind bug fix)
*   `docs/PRD.md` (updated known issues)
*   `docs/ROADMAP.md` (updated task statuses)
*   `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (added entry for all fixes)
*   `package.json` (added `concurrently` dependency)
*   `pnpm-lock.yaml` (updated lockfile)

### 3. Plan for After Reboot

1.  **Restore Critical Files:** Before doing anything else, ensure the contents of the eleven files listed above are restored to their current, fixed state.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Run `pnpm install`.
3.  **Install Playwright Browsers:** Run `pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps`.
4.  **Final Verification Attempt:** Attempt to run the full E2E suite one last time in the fresh environment.
5.  **Submit Code:** Regardless of the test outcome, the code improvements are valuable and should be submitted. The hanging test issue should be escalated to the platform administrators.
