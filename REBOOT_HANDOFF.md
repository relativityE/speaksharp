This document summarizes the current state of the project, the critical environmental issues, and the plan for after the next VM reboot.

### 1. Current Status & Task

*   **Current Task:** The primary goal is to resolve E2E test failures. The immediate task was to debug `tests/auth.e2e.spec.ts`, which is timing out.
*   **Critical Blocker:** The VM environment is in an unstable and unrecoverable state. All E2E tests that import `tests/sdkStubs.ts` hang indefinitely without producing any logs, even after extensive debugging. This prevents any productive work on the E2E suite.
*   **Progress Made:**
    *   A critical bug in `tests/sdkStubs.ts` that caused unhandled network routes was fixed.
    *   The Playwright browser binaries were successfully installed.
    *   The `dev:test` script in `package.json` was made more robust.
    *   Extensive documentation was added to `docs/PRD.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md` to track the unresolved issues.

### 2. Key Changes to Preserve

The following files have been modified and their changes are critical to preserve across the reboot to avoid losing progress:

*   **`tests/sdkStubs.ts`**: The fixed version with proper route handling.
*   **`package.json`**: Updated with the `--clearScreen false` flag in the `dev:test` script.
*   **`docs/PRD.md`**: Updated with the "Known Issue" of the E2E test hang.
*   **`docs/ROADMAP.md`**: Updated with the "Technical Debt" of the missing system dependencies.
*   **`pnpm-lock.yaml`**: The lockfile reflecting any new dependencies installed during the session.

### 3. Plan for After Reboot

1.  **Restore Critical Files:** Before doing anything else, restore the contents of the five files listed above.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Run `pnpm install`.
3.  **Install Playwright Browsers:** Run `pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps`.
4.  **Verify a Minimal Test:** Run the minimal `basic.e2e.spec.ts` test (which will need to be re-created) against a manually started server to confirm the baseline environment is working.
5.  **Re-evaluate the E2E Hang:** With a fresh environment, attempt to run `auth.e2e.spec.ts` again. If it still hangs, the issue is confirmed to be a fundamental incompatibility between the project and the sandbox environment, and will require escalation to system administrators.
6.  **If tests pass, submit the code fixes.** If the fresh environment resolves the hang, the issue was transient, and the code fixes can be submitted.
