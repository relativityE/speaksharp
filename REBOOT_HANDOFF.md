# REBOOT_HANDOFF.md

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-10 07:25:52

This document summarizes the current state of the project, the issues encountered, and the plan for after the VM reboot.

## Current Status

The primary goal is to implement a new, production-grade testing architecture based on Mock Service Worker (MSW). The following changes have been made:

*   **New Testing Architecture:** A new testing architecture has been implemented, including a separate `vitest.config.mjs` file, a new test setup file (`src/test-setup.js`), and a set of mock API handlers.
*   **Documentation Updates:** The `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/CHANGELOG.md` files have been updated to reflect the new testing architecture. The `docs/PRD.md` file has been updated with a "Known Issue" about the unstable test environment.

## Problems Encountered

The project is currently blocked by a persistent issue with the `vitest` unit test runner. The tests are timing out without providing any useful error messages.

**Debugging Steps Taken:**
*   Separated the `vite` and `vitest` configurations.
*   Improved the test cleanup logic in the test files.
*   Added extensive logging to the test setup, a complex test file, and the test script.
*   Isolated the tests and ran them one by one.
*   Confirmed that a simple test file runs correctly, but more complex tests are timing out.

**Hypothesis:**
The issue is likely a fundamental problem with the test runner setup or the execution environment, rather than a problem with the test files themselves.

## Plan for After Reboot

1.  **Read this file** to get up to speed on the current status.
2.  **Delete this file.**
3.  **Attempt to run the full unit test suite** (`pnpm test:unit`) to see if the environment reset has resolved the timeout issue.
4.  **If the tests still fail, proceed with the user's last debugging plan:**
    *   Systematically isolate the problematic test file by running them one by one.
    *   Fix the problematic test file.
    *   Run the full test suite to validate the fix.
5.  **Clean up** the temporary test files and directories.
6.  **Run the full test suite** (`./run-tests.sh`) to validate the fix.
7.  **Add `test-results/` to `.gitignore`**.
8.  **Documentation Review**.
9.  **Submit**.
