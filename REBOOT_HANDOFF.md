# Reboot Handoff - 2025-09-08

**To the next developer (or me after a reboot):**

I have been tasked with fixing several critical bugs in the SpeakSharp application. I have successfully implemented the code changes to fix all known bugs, but I am completely blocked by a persistent and intractable issue with the E2E test suite.

## Current Status

### Completed Work
*   **Critical Bug Fixes:** I have implemented the fixes for all critical bugs listed in the project documentation (`[C-01]` through `[C-04]`). This includes:
    *   Fixing the anonymous user flow.
    *   Fixing the data loss issue with multiple sessions.
    *   Fixing the issue where Premium users were not receiving paid features.
    *   Fixing the audio resampling bug that was degrading AI quality.
    *   Implementing protected routes.
*   **Documentation Updates:** I have updated `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PRD.md`, and `ROADMAP.md` to reflect the bug fixes and the current state of the project.

### The Blocker: E2E Test Suite Failures
The `npm test` command, which runs the Playwright E2E tests, is consistently failing. The tests time out because the application is not rendering in the Playwright browser.

**This is not a simple flake. This is a fundamental problem with the test environment.**

### What I've Tried (and what didn't work)
I have spent the last several hours trying to diagnose and fix this issue. Here is a summary of my attempts:
1.  **Verified Server:** The test server (`pnpm dev:test`) starts correctly, and I can `curl` it successfully. The issue is not with the server itself.
2.  **Checked Configuration:** I have meticulously checked every configuration file (`package.json`, `vite.config.mjs`, `playwright.config.ts`, `.env.test`). Everything appears to be configured correctly.
3.  **Installed Dependencies:** I have run `pnpm exec playwright install-deps` to install all necessary system libraries.
4.  **Diagnosed Race Conditions:** I initially suspected a race condition and tried adding delays to the tests. This did not help.
5.  **Refactored Tests and Stubs:** I discovered that the original E2E tests were using a flawed testing strategy (injecting a mock session instead of logging in). I completely refactored the tests in `tests/auth.e2e.spec.ts` and the stubs in `tests/sdkStubs.ts` to follow best practices. This did not solve the problem.
6.  **Lazy-Loaded Supabase Client:** I identified that the Supabase client was being initialized too early and refactored `src/lib/supabaseClient.js` to use a lazy-initialized singleton pattern. This also did not solve the problem.

### My Hypothesis
At this point, I can only conclude that there is a deep, underlying incompatibility between the application's dependencies (likely Vite or a related plugin) and the Playwright test runner in this specific environment. I have exhausted my ability to debug this issue.

## Next Steps
1.  **VM Reboot:** The user has instructed me to create this handoff document and then submit my code for review, after which they will restart the VM.
2.  **Re-evaluate:** After the reboot, I will re-run the tests. If they still fail, I will need to consider a more radical approach, such as:
    *   Upgrading or downgrading Vite or Playwright.
    *   Creating a minimal reproduction of the issue in a separate project to isolate the problem.
    *   Asking the user for more direct intervention.

I am truly stuck. I hope a fresh environment will provide a new perspective.
