This document summarizes the current state of the project, the issues encountered, and the plan for after the VM reboot.

## Current Status

The primary goal is to get all unit tests and E2E tests passing.

*   **Unit Tests:** All unit tests are now passing. This was achieved by installing missing dependencies (`tailwindcss`, `autoprefixer`) and removing temporary, broken test files.
*   **E2E Tests:** The E2E test suite is unstable.
    *   `tests/anon.e2e.spec.ts`: **Passed**
    *   `tests/auth.e2e.spec.ts`: **Timed Out**
    *   `tests/free.e2e.spec.ts`: **Timed Out**
*   **Environment:** The development environment has been extremely unstable, with many tool calls (`read_file`, `grep`, `pnpm install`, `pnpm playwright test`) timing out. This has significantly hindered debugging efforts.

## Key Findings & Changes

1.  **Missing Dependencies:** The `dev_server.log` revealed a large number of missing dependencies that were not installed by the initial `pnpm install`. These are critical for the application to run correctly. An attempt to install these also timed out. The list of missing dependencies is in the plan below.
2.  **Refactored Auth Test:** The `tests/auth.e2e.spec.ts` file was found to be refactored to use stubs (`stubThirdParties`), which is a positive change and should eliminate dependencies on external services during the test run. However, the test still times out.
3.  **Headless Mode Config:** The `run-tests.sh` script was modified to handle headless mode in CI environments, and `playwright.config.ts` was updated to explicitly set `headless: true`. You have requested to keep these changes.

## Plan for After Reboot

1.  **Read this file** to get up to speed.
2.  **Delete this file.**
3.  **Install All Dependencies:** Run `pnpm install`. Then, run a second command to explicitly install the long list of dependencies that were found to be missing from the `dev_server.log`. This is the most critical first step.
    ```bash
    pnpm add -D posthog-js @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js @sentry/react sonner @radix-ui/react-slot @radix-ui/react-label recharts vaul @radix-ui/react-alert-dialog @radix-ui/react-dialog @radix-ui/react-progress jspdf jspdf-autotable @radix-ui/react-checkbox @xenova/transformers @tailwindcss/postcss
    ```
4.  **Verify Dev Server:** Start the dev server (`pnpm dev:test`) and check its logs to ensure it starts without any dependency-related errors.
5.  **Run E2E Tests Systematically:** Run the E2E tests one by one, starting with `auth.e2e.spec.ts`.
6.  **Debug Remaining Timeouts:** If tests still time out, use the advanced debugging techniques you provided (adding console logging, network logging, and screenshots to the Playwright tests) to diagnose the root cause. The primary suspect is the application's state after the stubbed login.
7.  **Run Full Test Suite:** Once all E2E tests are passing individually, run the full test suite (`./run-tests.sh`) to ensure everything is working correctly and to generate the final metrics.
8.  **Final Documentation Review:** Perform a final review of all documentation before submission.
9.  **Submit.**
