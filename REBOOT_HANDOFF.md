# Reboot Handoff - 2025-09-09

**To the next developer (or me after a reboot):**

The repository has been reset to its initial state to resolve a series of cascading failures and incorrect states. The previous work resulted in a fully functional test suite and corrected documentation, but the process was flawed.

The immediate goal is to re-implement the complete, known-good solution from scratch on this clean base.

**Next Steps (The Restoration Plan):**

1.  **Initial Setup & Configuration:** Apply baseline configuration changes to `package.json` (add `postinstall` script), `postcss.config.js` (rename to `.cjs`), and create `.env.test`.
2.  **Fix Unit Tests:** Re-apply the final, correct versions of `test-utils.jsx`, `AuthContext.tsx`, `AuthPage.jsx`, and the `AuthPage.test.jsx`.
3.  **Fix E2E Tests:** Re-apply the final, correct versions of all E2E-related files (`useSpeechRecognition.js`, `LocalWhisper.js`, `sdkStubs.ts`, and all `*.e2e.spec.ts` files).
4.  **Documentation Cleanup:** Re-apply all documentation fixes: update `OUTLINE.md` and `AGENTS.md`, relocate content from unapproved markdown files, and delete them.
5.  **Implement Reporting Script:** Re-create the final, robust `run-tests.sh` script, update `package.json` with JSON reporters, and update `docs/PRD.md` with the SQM template.
6.  **Final Validation:** Run the script, get user approval, and prepare for final submission.

This handoff marks the starting point for the full restoration of the correct solution.
