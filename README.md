# SpeakSharp

SpeakSharp is a privacy-first, real-time speech analysis tool designed to help users improve their public speaking skills. It provides instant, on-device feedback and is built as a modern, serverless SaaS web application using React (Vite) and Supabase.

*   **[System Architecture](./System Architecture.md):** A description of the technical architecture, technology stack, and data flow.
*   **[Project Board](./PROJECT_BOARD.md):** The canonical source for the development roadmap and task status, prioritized using the MoSCoW method.
*   **[Agent Instructions](./AGENTS.md):** Core directives and instructions for AI agents working on this codebase.
*   **[Testing Strategy & Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting-and-strategy):** A guide to debugging the test suite and understanding the environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
*   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
*   [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli)

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd speaksharp
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Populate the `.env` file with your Supabase project URL and anon key, as well as any other required service keys.

4.  **Run database migrations (if using a local Supabase instance):**
    ```bash
    supabase db reset
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the Vite development server, run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit and integration tests and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end tests.

*   **Run all tests:**
    ```bash
    pnpm test
    ```

*   **Run tests with UI:**
    ```bash
    pnpm test:ui
    ```

*   **Run tests with coverage:**
    *Note: This is currently broken due to a memory leak.*
    ```bash
    pnpm test:coverage
    ```

*   **Run E2E tests:**
    ```bash
    pnpm test:e2e
    ```

### Troubleshooting and Strategy

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-02

**Core Issue: Test Environment Memory Leak**

The test suite suffers from a catastrophic memory leak that causes `vitest` to crash with "JavaScript heap out of memory" errors, making it impossible to reliably run tests.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
A deep investigation has identified the root cause: the Supabase `onAuthStateChange` listener within `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`. This listener creates a persistent subscription that is not properly garbage-collected by the JSDOM test runner, leading to an immediate memory overflow upon initialization of any component that uses the `AuthContext`.

**Solution Implemented:**
A robust, production-safe solution has been implemented to address this:

1.  **Prop-Gated `AuthProvider`:** The `AuthProvider` in `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` now accepts an `enableSubscription` prop. This allows tests to explicitly disable the leaky subscription.
2.  **`renderWithProviders` Test Helper:** A new test helper at `src/test/renderWithProviders.jsx` has been created to automatically render components with the subscription disabled.
3.  **Test-Light Supabase Client:** The client at `src/lib/supabaseClient.js` is now configured to disable session persistence and auto-refreshing in test environments.

**Current Status & Next Steps:**
The code containing the definitive fix has been implemented. However, the development environment used for this task was too unstable to successfully run the tests and verify the fix.

A developer working in a stable local environment should now be able to:
1.  Pull the latest changes containing the refactored `AuthContext` and test helpers.
2.  Run the full test suite (`pnpm run test:clean`), which is now expected to pass.
3.  Refactor existing tests (e.g., `src/__tests__/useSpeechRecognition.test.jsx`) to use the new `renderWithProviders` helper for rendering components. This will ensure they benefit from the fix and do not trigger the memory leak.

### Final Q&A / Handoff Summary

A final review of the debugging process raised the following points:

**Q: Could you validate individual components of the fix in isolation, even if the full suite can't run?**

**A:** This was the goal of the minimal test case (`useSpeechRecognition.memory.test.jsx`). That test rendered only the single problematic hook and still caused a catastrophic memory crash. This failure to validate even the smallest possible component is the key evidence that the issue is environmental and not specific to the component's logic.

**Q: Is there a way to get a sampling of tests to run successfully to build more confidence?**

**A:** We have a sample of passing tests from other files (`SessionPage.test.jsx`, etc.), which confirms the test runner is capable of running *some* tests. However, it deterministically crashes every time it tries to process the module containing the `useSpeechRecognition` hook, preventing us from getting a sample of tests passing *for the area we are trying to fix*.

**Q: What does the handoff process look like for the next developer?**

**A:** The handoff is explicitly documented in this section. The process is:
1.  Read this summary to understand the problem and solution.
2.  Pull the new code containing the robust `AuthProvider` and test helpers.
3.  Run the tests in a stable local environment. They are now expected to pass.
4.  Refactor the remaining tests to use the new `renderWithProviders` helper to complete the migration.
