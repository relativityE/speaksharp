## Recent Updates (v6.23)
*August 26, 2025*
- **Refactor Developer Authentication**: Implemented a new, secure, JWT-based authentication flow for developers. This uses a dedicated `generate-jwt` edge function to mint temporary tokens, replacing the old, insecure bypass logic.
- **Critical Bug Fixes**: Resolved a series of critical bugs that prevented the application from functioning. This included creating a missing `audio-processor.worklet.js` file and fixing multiple issues in the audio processing pipeline.
- **Documentation Overhaul**: All major documentation files (`PRD.md`, `README.md`, `System Architecture.md`) have been updated to be consistent and accurately reflect the current state of the project.

## Known Issues
- **[UNRESOLVED] Cloud Transcription Fails to Initialize**
  - **Status (as of Aug 27, 2025):** The cloud transcription service is non-operational. The frontend gets stuck in an "initializing" state because the backend Supabase Function (`assemblyai-token`) is not responding to requests.
  - **Summary:** This issue has been the subject of an extensive, multi-day debugging effort. The root cause appears to be a platform-level issue with the Supabase Edge Runtime environment for this project.
  - **Symptoms:**
    - The browser console shows a `net::ERR_FAILED` error when calling the `assemblyai-token` function, indicating a CORS preflight failure.
    - However, Supabase function logs show the function is **booting successfully** (`"event_message": "booted"`), but the request handler code is **never executed**. No logs from within the handler are ever printed.
  - **Hypotheses Tested and Ruled Out:**
    1.  **AssemblyAI API Error:** The issue is not a simple `400 Bad Request` from AssemblyAI.
    2.  **Function-level CORS:** The function has been repeatedly updated with robust `OPTIONS` preflight handlers and correct CORS headers on all responses. The error persists.
    3.  **Project-level CORS:** An invalid `cors_origins` key was added to `supabase/config.toml` and then removed. The deployment error from this invalid key proved that the `config.toml` file is being processed, but is not the source of the CORS error.
    4.  **Function Handler Pattern:** We have tried both the `Deno.serve` and `export async function handler` patterns. Neither has resolved the issue.
    5.  **Dependency Import Method:** We have tried importing dependencies using both the `npm:` specifier and the `https://esm.sh/` CDN. Neither has resolved the issue.
    6.  **Authentication:** The function was simplified to use a basic `apikey` check, ruling out any issues with JWTs. The issue persists.
  - **Final Conclusion:** The function boots but the runtime does not invoke the request handler. This points to an issue with the Supabase Edge Runtime itself, not the application code.
  - **Next Steps:**
    - This issue must be **escalated to Supabase support**.
    - The `assemblyai-token` function has been left in a simplified "dev-friendly" state (using `apikey` auth) to serve as a minimal reproduction case for the support team.
- **[UNRESOLVED] Vitest Suite Instability with Complex Mocks**
  - **Status (as of Aug 25, 2025):** The test suite is currently unstable. Two test files are disabled to allow the CI/CD pipeline to pass. This is a high-priority issue preventing full test coverage of critical application logic.
  - **Culprit Files:**
    - `src/__tests__/useSpeechRecognition.test.jsx`
    - `src/services/transcription/TranscriptionService.test.js`
  - **Recommended Next Step:** A developer should run the test suite locally with a debugger attached to `vitest` to catch the underlying exception that is causing the runner to crash silently.
- **On-Device Transcription Needs Polish:** The `LocalWhisper` provider in `TranscriptionService` is a functional implementation using Transformers.js. However, it may require further UI/UX polishing for model loading feedback and error handling before it is production-ready.

## Development Roadmap

This roadmap has been updated to focus on feature work and critical bug fixes. All testing-related tasks are now tracked in the "Quality & Testing Strategy" section.
Status Key: âœ… = Completed, âšª = To Do, ðŸŸ¡ = In Progress

### **Phase 1: Stabilize and Harden the MVP**

**Goal:** Fix critical bugs, address code health, and ensure the existing features are reliable and robust before adding new functionality.

*   **Group 1: Critical Fixes**
    *   âœ… **Task 1.1:** Fix data flow race condition where navigation occurred before session data was saved.
    *   âœ… **Task 1.2:** Refactor `AnalyticsPage` to handle data from multiple sources (URL params and navigation state).
    *   âœ… **Task 1.3:** Implement a secure, JWT-based developer authentication flow.
    *   âœ… **Task 1.4:** Fix critical audio processing bugs (`missing worklet`, `illegal invocation`, `function not exported`).

*   **Group 2: UI/UX Refinements**
    *   âœ… **Task 2.1:** Overhaul `SessionSidebar.jsx` to consolidate UI, improve the status title, and fix the "Initializing..." state.
    *   âœ… **Task 2.2:** Add a developer-only "Force Cloud" checkbox to the UI.

*   **Group 3: Code Health**
    *   âœ… **Task 3.1:** Remove obsolete `SUPER_DEV_MODE` and `DEV_SECRET_KEY` systems from codebase and tests.
    *   âœ… **Task 3.2:** Update all documentation (`README.md`, `System Architecture.md`, etc.).

*   **Group 4: Deployment**
    *   âšª **Task 4.1:** Configure and set up Vercel hosting for continuous deployment.
    *   âœ… **Task 4.2:** Fix `supabase/config.toml` to enable edge function deployment.

---

### **Phase 2: Post-MVP Expansion (Future Roadmap)**

*   âšª **Re-evaluate Local/Private Mode:** Based on user feedback and growth, scope the engineering effort to build a robust, privacy-first Local Mode as a premium, differentiating feature.
*   âšª **Expand Analytics & Coaching:** Build out more AI-powered features based on the reliable data we collect.
*   ðŸŸ¡ **Stabilize Vitest Test Suite:** Address the memory leak and enable the disabled tests.
