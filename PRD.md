# SpeakSharp Product Requirements Document

**Version 6.25** | **Last Updated: August 28, 2025**

## 1. Executive Summary

SpeakSharp is a **privacy-first, real-time speech analysis tool** designed as a modern, serverless SaaS web application. Its architecture is strategically aligned with the core product goal: to provide instant, on-device feedback that helps users improve their public speaking skills, while rigorously protecting their privacy.

The system is built for speed, both in user experience and development velocity. It leverages a **React (Vite)** frontend for a highly interactive UI and **Supabase** as an all-in-one backend for data, authentication, and user management.


## 2. Recent Updates (v6.25)
*August 28, 2025*
- **Full End-to-End Stability**: Resolved critical bugs related to state management, component lifecycle, and navigation that affected the core user flow.
- **Test Suite Revamp**: Overhauled the entire test suite. Fixed all failing tests, resolved all console warnings (`act`, `forwardRef`), and added a new suite of unit tests for the cloud transcription service. The test suite is now stable and reliable.
- **Improved UX**: The transcript panel now provides clearer feedback to the user about the microphone state.

## 3. Known Issues
- **[RESOLVED] Cloud Transcription Fails to Initialize**
  - **Status (as of Aug 28, 2025):** The cloud transcription service has been fixed and is now operational.
  - **Summary of Fix:** The issue was not with the Supabase Edge Runtime as previously hypothesized. The root cause was in the frontend client. The client was sending base64-encoded audio data wrapped in JSON objects, which is incompatible with the AssemblyAI v3 WebSocket API. The message parsing logic was also incorrect for the v3 API.
- **[RESOLVED] Vitest Suite Instability with Complex Mocks**
  - **Status (as of Aug 28, 2025):** The test suite is now stable and all tests are passing without warnings.
  - **Summary of Fix:** The instability was caused by several issues, including incorrect asynchronous test patterns, flawed mock implementations, and components not correctly forwarding refs. The suite was fixed by implementing `waitFor` for async state updates, correcting the WebSocket mock to include static properties, and wrapping UI components in `React.forwardRef`.
- **[RESOLVED] Tailwind CSS Build Failure and Styling Integration:** A series of critical misconfigurations were identified and fixed. The root causes were an incompatible `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin, a disconnected theme configuration, and incorrect dependency versions. The application's theme is now correctly integrated with Tailwind via CSS variables, and the build process is stable.
- **[BLOCKER] Critical Rendering Failure in E2E Environment:** Despite fixing all known build, configuration, dependency, and client-side errors, the application still fails to render in the Playwright E2E test environment. The root cause is unknown and persists even after a full environment reset, indicating a deep, elusive issue. Manual inspection in a live browser is required.
- **On-Device Transcription Needs Polish:** The `LocalWhisper` provider in `TranscriptionService` is a functional implementation using Transformers.js. However, it may require further UI/UX polishing for model loading feedback and error handling before it is production-ready.

## 4. Development Roadmap
This roadmap has been updated to track the stabilization and enhancement of the AssemblyAI v3 streaming transcription feature. The canonical source for this plan is [`PROJECT_BOARD.md`](./PROJECT_BOARD.md).

## 5. Software Quality Metrics

This section tracks key software quality metrics for the project. These are baseline measurements taken on August 26, 2025.

| Metric                        | Current Value | Industry Standard | Notes                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Test Coverage (Lines)**     | `42.99%`      | `70-80%`          | Percentage of code lines executed by tests.     |
| **Code Bloat (Uncovered Code)** | `57.01%`      | `N/A`             | Percentage of code lines not covered by tests.  |

## 6. Metrics and Success Criteria

### Service Level Indicators (SLIs) & Objectives (SLOs)

**SLIs (what we measure):**

- üïë **Time to first transcript chunk (latency)** ‚Äî ms between mic start and first transcript event.
- ‚ö° **End-to-end transcription latency (speed)** ‚Äî avg delay between spoken word and displayed text.
- üìâ **WebSocket error rate** ‚Äî % of sessions terminated by non-1000 close codes.
- üîÑ **Reconnect success rate** ‚Äî % of reconnect attempts that resume within 2s.
- üîê **Token issuance error rate** ‚Äî % of failed requests to /assemblyai-token.
- üí∞ **Cost guardrail** ‚Äî $/minute STT usage per active user session.

**SLOs (targets):**

- <2s to first transcript chunk (p95).
- <500ms streaming transcription delay (p90).
- <1% WebSocket error rate.
- >95% reconnect success rate within 2s.
- <0.5% token issuance failures.
- <$0.05/min STT cost at MVP scale.
