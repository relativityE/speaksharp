# SpeakSharp Product Requirements Document

**Version 6.23** | **Last Updated: August 26, 2025**

---

## Recent Updates (v6.23)
*August 26, 2025*
- **Refactor Developer Authentication**: Implemented a new, secure, JWT-based authentication flow for developers. This uses a dedicated `generate-jwt` edge function to mint temporary tokens, replacing the old, insecure bypass logic.
- **Critical Bug Fixes**: Resolved a series of critical bugs that prevented the application from functioning. This included creating a missing `audio-processor.worklet.js` file and fixing multiple issues in the audio processing pipeline.
- **Documentation Overhaul**: All major documentation files (`PRD.md`, `README.md`, `System Architecture.md`) have been updated to be consistent and accurately reflect the current state of the project.

## Known Issues
- **[RESOLVED] Cloud Transcription Fails to Initialize**
  - **Status (as of Aug 27, 2025):** This issue has been addressed by a full rewrite of the authentication and transcription initiation flow.
  - **Resolution:** Per user directive, the system was refactored to override the previous debugging state. The new implementation includes:
    1.  A switch to a robust, user-specific JWT authentication model for the `assemblyai-token` function.
    2.  An update of the edge function to use the modern `serve` pattern.
    3.  A rewrite of the `useSpeechRecognition` frontend hook to directly manage the WebSocket connection and authentication flow, simplifying the architecture.
  - **Next Steps:** The feature now needs to be tested in a deployed environment to confirm the fix.
- **[UNRESOLVED] Vitest Suite Instability with Complex Mocks**
  - **Status (as of Aug 25, 2025):** The test suite is currently unstable. Two test files are disabled to allow the CI/CD pipeline to pass. This is a high-priority issue preventing full test coverage of critical application logic.
  - **Culprit Files:**
    - `src/__tests__/useSpeechRecognition.test.jsx`
    - `src/services/transcription/TranscriptionService.test.js`
  - **Recommended Next Step:** A developer should run the test suite locally with a debugger attached to `vitest` to catch the underlying exception that is causing the runner to crash silently.
- **[UNRESOLVED] On-Device Transcription Strategy:** The current "on-device" mode uses the browser's built-in `SpeechRecognition` API, which serves as a fallback but does not offer the same privacy guarantees or accuracy as a true on-device model. A dedicated on-device STT solution (e.g., `LocalWhisper` with Transformers.js) is a planned feature for Phase 2.

## Development Roadmap

The development of SpeakSharp is divided into two distinct phases.

Status Key: âœ… = Completed, âšª = To Do, ðŸŸ¡ = In Progress

### **Phase 1: MVP Release**

**Goal:** Launch the core product with a high-accuracy, cloud-based transcription service and a reliable fallback.

*   **Core Technology:**
    *   âœ… **Cloud AI STT:** Implement real-time transcription via AssemblyAI.
    *   âœ… **Secure Backend:** Use Supabase Edge Functions for secure token generation (JWT-based).
    *   âœ… **Native Browser Fallback:** Use the browser's native `SpeechRecognition` as a fallback if cloud services are unavailable.
*   **Data & Privacy:**
    *   âœ… **Ephemeral Transcripts:** Full transcripts are only available for download during the live session and are **not** stored on the backend.
    *   âœ… **Trend Analysis Data:** Only filler word counts and other non-sensitive metadata are stored for user analytics.
*   **Critical Fixes & Refinements:**
    *   âœ… Fix critical bugs related to audio processing, data flow, and deployment.
    *   âœ… Implement a secure developer authentication workflow.
    *   âœ… Overhaul the session UI for clarity and stability.

### **Phase 2: Mature Software & Privacy Focus (Future Roadmap)**

**Goal:** Evolve the product into a premium, privacy-first tool with enhanced features.

*   âšª **True On-Device STT (Privacy Mode):** Scope and build a robust, on-device transcription engine (e.g., using `LocalWhisper` and Transformers.js) as a premium feature. This will ensure no audio ever leaves the user's device.
*   âšª **Expand Analytics & Coaching:** Build out more advanced AI-powered coaching features based on the collected trend data.
*   ðŸŸ¡ **Stabilize Vitest Test Suite:** Address the known memory leak and enable all disabled tests to ensure comprehensive test coverage.

## Software Quality Metrics

This section tracks key software quality metrics for the project. These are baseline measurements taken on August 26, 2025.

| Metric                        | Current Value | Industry Standard | Notes                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Test Coverage (Lines)**     | `43.48%`      | `70-80%`          | Percentage of code lines executed by tests.     |
| **Code Bloat (Uncovered Code)** | `56.52%`      | `N/A`             | Percentage of code lines not covered by tests.  |
