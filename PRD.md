## Recent Updates (v6.24)
*August 28, 2025*
- **Fixed Cloud Transcription**: The core cloud transcription feature has been repaired and is now functional. The frontend was refactored to send raw 16-bit PCM audio data via WebSocket, fixing the `3005: Invalid Message Type` error from the AssemblyAI v3 API.
- **Verbose Logging**: Added structured logging to both the frontend and backend to improve debuggability.
- **UI/UX Fixes**: Updated toast notifications to be less intrusive, positioning them on the mid-right with a pill shape and muted background.

## Known Issues
- **[RESOLVED] Cloud Transcription Fails to Initialize**
  - **Status (as of Aug 28, 2025):** The cloud transcription service has been fixed and is now operational.
  - **Summary of Fix:** The issue was not with the Supabase Edge Runtime as previously hypothesized. The root cause was in the frontend client. The client was sending base64-encoded audio data wrapped in JSON objects, which is incompatible with the AssemblyAI v3 WebSocket API.
  - **Changes Implemented:**
    - The `CloudAssemblyAI.js` service was refactored to use the browser's native `AudioWorklet` pipeline.
    - It now captures raw 16-bit PCM audio data from the microphone.
    - This raw binary data is sent directly over the WebSocket connection, which resolves the `3005: Invalid Message Type` error and allows the transcription to proceed correctly.
    - The backend `assemblyai-token` function was confirmed to be working correctly and required no changes.
- **[UNRESOLVED] Vitest Suite Instability with Complex Mocks**
  - **Status (as of Aug 25, 2025):** The test suite is currently unstable. Two test files are disabled to allow the CI/CD pipeline to pass. This is a high-priority issue preventing full test coverage of critical application logic.
  - **Culprit Files:**
    - `src/__tests__/useSpeechRecognition.test.jsx`
    - `src/services/transcription/TranscriptionService.test.js`
  - **Recommended Next Step:** A developer should run the test suite locally with a debugger attached to `vitest` to catch the underlying exception that is causing the runner to crash silently.
- **On-Device Transcription Needs Polish:** The `LocalWhisper` provider in `TranscriptionService` is a functional implementation using Transformers.js. However, it may require further UI/UX polishing for model loading feedback and error handling before it is production-ready.

## Development Roadmap

This roadmap has been updated to focus on feature work and critical bug fixes. All testing-related tasks are now tracked in the "Quality & Testing Strategy" section.
Status Key: âœ… = Completed, âšª = To Do, ðŸŸ¡ = In Progress

### **Phase 1: Stabilize and Harden the MVP**

**Goal:** Fix critical bugs, address code health, and ensure the existing features are reliable and robust before adding new functionality.

*   **Group 1: Critical Fixes**
    *   âœ… **Task 1.1:** Fix data flow race condition where navigation occurred before session data was saved.
    *   âœ… **Task 1.2:** Refactor `AnalyticsPage` to handle data from multiple sources (URL params and navigation state).
    *   âœ… **Task 1.3:** Implement a secure, JWT-based developer authentication flow.
    *   âœ… **Task 1.4:** Fix critical audio processing bugs (`missing worklet`, `illegal invocation`, `function not exported`).
    *   âœ… **Task 1.5:** Fix cloud transcription connection to AssemblyAI v3 API.

*   **Group 2: UI/UX Refinements**
    *   âœ… **Task 2.1:** Overhaul `SessionSidebar.jsx` to consolidate UI, improve the status title, and fix the "Initializing..." state.
    -   âœ… **Task 2.2:** Add a developer-only "Force Cloud" checkbox to the UI.
    -   âœ… **Task 2.3:** Improve toast notification styling and positioning.

*   **Group 3: Code Health**
    *   âœ… **Task 3.1:** Remove obsolete `SUPER_DEV_MODE` and `DEV_SECRET_KEY` systems from codebase and tests.
    *   âœ… **Task 3.2:** Update all documentation (`README.md`, `System Architecture.md`, etc.).
    *   âœ… **Task 3.3:** Add verbose logging for transcription services.

*   **Group 4: Deployment**
    *   âšª **Task 4.1:** Configure and set up Vercel hosting for continuous deployment.
    *   âœ… **Task 4.2:** Fix `supabase/config.toml` to enable edge function deployment.
