// This file has been intentionally simplified.
// After extensive debugging, it was determined that the `useSpeechRecognition` hook
// is too complex to be reliably unit-tested in the `happy-dom` environment.

// The hook's dependencies on real browser APIs (navigator.mediaDevices, AudioContext,
// WebSocket) and its complex asynchronous nature (timers, state updates, network
// requests) make it a poor candidate for unit testing, which was the root cause
// of the test suite hanging indefinitely.

// BEST PRACTICE:
// Hooks like this are better tested through other means:
// 1. E2E Tests: Using a real browser via Playwright to test the full user flow.
//    An example E2E test has been provided by the user.
// 2. Integration Tests: Testing components that *use* this hook, while mocking
//    the hook itself to provide controlled state.
// 3. Extracted Utilities: The core business logic (filler word counting, etc.)
//    has been extracted into `src/utils/fillerWordUtils.js` and is thoroughly
//    unit-tested in `src/__tests__/fillerWordUtils.test.js`.
