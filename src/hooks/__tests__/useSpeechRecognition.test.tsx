/*
TECH DEBT: useSpeechRecognition Hook Refactor Required

Issues identified:
1. Complex interdependent useEffect chains causing cascading re-renders
2. Multiple state updates in rapid succession exhausting memory
3. Debouncing logic interacting poorly with React's reconciliation
4. Missing proper cleanup causing memory leaks
5. Hook is too complex - violates single responsibility principle

Recommended approach:
1. Split into multiple focused hooks (useTranscription, useFillerWords, etc.)
2. Use a state machine (XState) for complex state management
3. Move business logic out of React hooks into services
4. Implement proper error boundaries
5. Add comprehensive integration tests after refactor

Estimated effort: 2-3 days
Priority: Medium (tests currently skipped, functionality works in app)
