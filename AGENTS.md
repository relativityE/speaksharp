# Agent Instructions for SpeakSharp Repository

---

## 🚨 Critical Environment Rules

* ⏱️ **7-Minute Timeout Constraint**
  Every script or command must complete within 7 minutes. If longer, split the work into multiple runs.

⚠️ Environment Stabilization
  Before any task, run:
    ./env-stabilizer.sh
  
  * This ensures a clean, stable environment by:
  * Killing lingering node, vite, and Playwright processes
  * Clearing caches and temporary files
  * Verifying critical ports (5173, 9323) are free
  * Installing dependencies via pnpm setup:dev
  * Running a quick sanity check to verify Vite starts

📖 Read the README.md Before Running Anything
  The agent must read README.md to understand the correct setup and workflow.
  This prevents mistakes like using pnpm install directly instead of the required pnpm setup:dev.

* ✅ **Local Audit Script (Read From README.md)**
  Always use the **designated local audit script** (documented in `README.md`) to run lint, type-checking, and unit/E2E tests.

  * Do **not** invent your own runner.
  * If the README’s script fails or is missing, stop and escalate.
  * The current runner is `./test-audit.sh`, but this name may change — so check `README.md` first.

* ⚠️ **Recovery Scripts Hierarchy**

  1. **Always run `./env-stabilizer.sh` first** to kill zombie processes, clear caches, and verify ports.
  2. If stability still fails, **ask before running `./vm-recovery.sh`**. Never execute without explicit user approval.

## ⚡ Quick Reference – Non-Negotiable Rules

1. ✅ **Environment Stabilization** – Always begin with `./env-stabilizer.sh`.
2. ✅ **Codebase Context** –

   * Run `pnpm setup:dev` (❌ never `pnpm install`).
   * Inspect `/src`, `/tests`, `/contexts`, and `/docs` before acting.
   * **Read `README.md` first** to ground yourself in current scripts and workflows.
3. ❌ **No Code Reversals Without Consent** – Never undo or revert user work without approval.
4. ⏱️ **Status Updates** – Provide updates every 5 minutes if tasks run long.

Think like a **senior engineer**: safe, evidence-based, long-term stable.

## 🚦 Pre-Check-In List (MANDATORY)

You must complete all items **before any commit/PR**:

1. **Run Local Audit Script**

   * Use the script defined in `README.md` (currently `./test-audit.sh`).
   * It runs linting, type-checking, and core unit tests.
   * All errors must be resolved.

2. **Documentation**

   * Update: `README.md`, `docs/OUTLINE.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
   * Ensure alignment with SSOT rules.

3. **Traceability**

   * Link every change to PRD/Architecture/Roadmap.

4. **Security & Dependencies**

   * Run `pnpm audit` after dependency changes.
   * Document in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

5. **Branch & Commit Hygiene**

   * Branches: `feature/...`, `fix/...`, `chore/...`.
   * Commit messages summarize actual changes.

6. **Final User Confirmation**

   * Ask:

     > "All checks complete. May I run the environment recovery script (`./vm-recovery.sh`)?"

   * Proceed **only after explicit approval**.

---

## 🚨 Absolute Non-Negotiables

* ❌ Never run `./vm-recovery.sh` without asking first.
* ❌ Never exceed the 7-minute runtime per command.
* ❌ Never undo or destroy user work without consent.
* 📄 Docs before code review — always.
* 🔐 Security first — no leaks, no unsafe shortcuts.
* 🧩 No unapproved dependencies.
* 💰 No cost-incurring services without consent.
* 🧠 Think like a senior engineer — long-term, safe, evidence-driven.

## 🔍 Task Workflow

0. **Contextual Review** - Read docs in /docs and README.md before acting.
1. **Stabilize** – Run `./env-stabilizer.sh`.
2. **Grounding** – Read `README.md` and `/docs`.
3. **Codebase Deep Dive** – Inspect actual code, not assumptions.
4. **Strategic Consultation** – Present root cause + 2–3 solution paths before major changes.
5. **Implementation** – Follow coding standards + architecture principles.
6. **Validation** – Complete Pre-Check-In List.
7. **Submission** – Ask user before running any recovery scripts.

## 📢 Escalation Protocol

If blocked:

* Summarize the problem.
* List what you tried.
* Provide hypotheses.
* Offer 2–3 solution paths with pros/cons.
* **Pause and wait for user guidance.**
