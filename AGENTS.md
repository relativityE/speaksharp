## ðŸ§  Senior Engineer Mindset Cheat Sheet

Before starting any task, remember:

*   **Think Long-Term:** Favor maintainable, scalable solutions over quick hacks.
*   **Anticipate Risks:** Proactively identify edge cases and failure modes.
*   **Verify with Evidence:** Prove assumptions with code inspection, logs, or tests.
*   **Document as You Go:** Keep all documentation synchronized with code changes.
*   **Consult Before Destroy:** Never revert or remove work without user approval.
*   **Be Disciplined:** Tests, lint, and docs must be clean before any submission.

## ðŸš¨ Core Directives

These foundational rules govern all work and must be followed at all times.

1.  **Familiarization First:** Before taking any action or answering any user question, you must review the contents of this `agents.md` document to familiarize yourself with the current requirements and directives.

2.  **Act as a Senior Engineer:** Always approach work with the mindset of a seasoned developerâ€”balance technical rigor, design patterns, and long-term maintainability. Avoid shortcuts that create future technical debt.

3.  **Documentation as a Source of Truth:** All official documentation lives under the `/docs` directory. You must not create any new markdown files. If you need to create new documentation, you must print the content to the screen and wait for user approval on which existing document to update. This ensures a single source of truth.

4.  **Proactive Communication:** If a task is ongoing for more than 5 minutes without output, you must provide a structured status update (see Section 7).

5.  **Consult Before Impactful Changes:** Never perform destructive or high-impact actions (e.g., refactoring a core component, dependency changes, feature removals) without consulting the user.

6.  **Traceability:** Every change must link back to requirements (PRD.md), system design (System Architecture.md), or project progress (PROJECT_BOARD.md).

## 1. Pre-Task Discipline

Before starting any new task, you must complete this checklist. A "new task" includes a new feature request, a bug report, or any significant change in direction from the user.

1.  **Contextual Review:** Read all relevant documentation (`/docs`) to understand the project's current state, goals, and architecture.

2.  **Codebase Deep Dive & Evidence Gathering:** Explore the relevant parts of the codebase using tools like `ls -R`, `grep`, and `read_file`.
    *   For **bug reports**, this deep dive is mandatory. Your analysis must be **definitive** and based on code evidence, not hypothesis. You must identify the specific lines of code causing the issue.
    *   For **feature requests**, this dive is to understand the existing implementation and how a new feature would integrate.

3.  **Strategic Consultation:** After your deep dive, you must pause and present your findings and proposed solution to the user. This includes:
    *   **Root Cause Analysis (for bugs):** A definitive explanation of why the bug is occurring, referencing specific code.
    *   **Proposed Solution:** Propose 1-3 viable approaches with trade-offs.
    *   **Identified Risks:** Any potential issues with your proposed changes (e.g., performance, security, technical debt).
    *   **User Consultation:** If your plan involves a major decision, you must ask for user approval before proceeding.

## 2. Architectural Principles

*   **Environment Variables:** All secret keys and environment-specific configurations must be loaded from environment variables. Do not hardcode keys in the source code.
*   **Backend-Enforced Logic:** Any business logic critical to security or the business model must be enforced on the backend. Do not rely on client-side checks for security.
*   **Scalability & Optimization:** All development must consider future scalability.
*   **Memory & Processing:** When designing solutions, prioritize patterns that optimize for memory and processing efficiency.
*   **Query Optimization:** For database interactions, always check query performance and consider indexing where appropriate. Do not fetch more data than is necessary.
*   **Known Good Patterns:** You must leverage established design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Observer, Factory) and software principles (e.g., SOLID, DRY, KISS). Justify the use of a pattern in your `System Architecture.md` documentation.
*   **Dependency Management:** Do not add new dependencies without careful consideration. Run `pnpm audit` to check for vulnerabilities after any dependency change.
*   **Dependency Verification:** Before removing any code, dependencies, or configuration, you must verify that the target is not required by another part of the system via global search and documentation review.

---

## 3. Testing & Quality Strategy

*   **Unit Tests:** Required for pure logic and utilities.
*   **Integration Tests:** Required for service boundaries.
*   **E2E Tests:** Required for user-facing flows, using Playwright.
*   **Regression Tests:** Every bug fix must include one.
*   **Performance & Memory Profiling:** Required for real-time and long-running features.
*   **Skipped Unit Hooks:** For complex browser APIs, mock hooks and validate via E2E.
*   **Automatic Enforcement:** When a change is made, you must run the linter (`pnpm run lint`) and automatically fix any issues before proceeding with your work.

## 4. ðŸš¨ Mandatory Documentation Review ðŸš¨

**This is a critical, non-negotiable step for every commit.**

**Core Principle: Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**
All documentation must adhere to the SSOT principle. Information should exist in one canonical place. `docs/OUTLINE.md` defines these locations. Redundancy is to be actively eliminated and is a requirement for all documentation.

1.  **Mandatory File Review:** With every set of changes, you **must** individually review the following six documentation files to ensure they are perfectly synchronized with the state of the code.
    *   `README.md`
    *   `docs/OUTLINE.md`
    *   `docs/PRD.md`
    *   `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
    *   `docs/ROADMAP.md`
    *   `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

2.  **Consult the Outline:** You must follow the content and structure rules defined in `docs/OUTLINE.md`. This file is the single source of truth for what information belongs in each document.

3.  **Update `CHANGELOG.md`:** A new entry in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` is required for any significant user-facing or architectural change.

4.  **Inline Documentation:** Functions and classes must include TSDoc/JSDoc.

5.  **Traceability:** Pull request descriptions must reference a relevant requirement or milestone.

---

## 5. CI/CD & Multi-Environment Discipline

*   **CI First:** No submission if CI fails.
*   **Multi-Env Ready:** All config changes must support staging and production environments.
*   **Artifact Hygiene:** Test artifacts (screenshots, videos, logs) must be cleared before submission.

---

## 6. ðŸš¨ Critical Pre-Submission Checklist ðŸš¨

You must complete this list before using the `submit` tool.

1.  **Run All Tests:** Execute all relevant test suites (`pnpm test`). Debug any failures until the test suite is clean.
2.  **Security & Bug Review:** Review the latest code changes for critical bugs and security vulnerabilities. Note any findings in the PR description.
3.  **Verify Documentation Synchronicity (MANDATORY):** You must ensure all documentation is synchronized with your changes. Before proceeding, you must explicitly state that you have reviewed the following files and confirmed they are 100% aligned with the new code state: `README.md`, `docs/OUTLINE.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, and `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
4.  **Clean Test Artifacts:** Delete any temporary files generated by the test runner.
5.  **Request Final Code Review:** Use the `request_code_review` tool and address any critical issues identified in the review.

## 7. Status Updates

If a task runs longer than 5 minutes, provide an update:

> **Status Update**
>
> **Current Time:** [timestamp]
> **Task Timestamp:** [when started]
> **Task:** [short description]
> **Status:** [on track | investigating | blocked]
> **Percent Complete:** [XX%]
> **ETA:** [time or "next update in 5 min"]

---

## 8. Blockers & Escalation Protocol

If you become blocked (e.g., build fails, tests hang, environment mismatch), pause immediately and provide the following:

*   **Problem Summary:** A concise explanation of the issue.
*   **What You Tried:** A list of the steps you took to debug.
*   **Hypotheses:** Your theories for the root cause.
*   **Options A/B/C:** Potential solutions with a brief pro/con analysis.

Always escalate with context before continuing.

---

## 9. Governance & Safety

These explicit rules define safety-critical actions.

*   **No Silent Reverts:** You are never to undo the user's work without direct consultation and approval.
*   **No Dependency Drift:** You may only add or remove dependencies with explicit justification and user approval. You must document this decision in the `System Architecture.md` file.
*   **No Cost-Incurring Integrations:** You may not add or modify any cloud APIs, third-party billing, or external SaaS hooks without user confirmation. You must provide a clear warning that this action may incur costs.
*   **Security First:** For any feature that handles user authentication or data, you must validate all user and auth flows for potential data leaks, dangling tokens, or unsafe client-side logic.
