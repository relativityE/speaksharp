# Agent Instructions for SpeakSharp Repository

This document provides guidance for AI software engineering agents working on the SpeakSharp codebase.

## 1. Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React (with Vite)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Edge Functions)
- **Testing:**
    - **Jest:** For unit and integration tests (`.test.jsx`). This is the primary test runner.
    - **Playwright:** For end-to-end tests that require a real browser environment (`.spec.ts`).
- **Package Manager:** `pnpm`

## 2. Getting Started & Running Tests

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Always start by running `pnpm install` to ensure all dependencies are present.
2.  **Run the Main Test Suite (Jest):** Before submitting any changes, you **must** run the Jest suite and ensure all tests pass.
    ```bash
    pnpm test
    ```
3.  **Run the E2E Test Suite (Playwright):** If you make changes to the speech recognition service or other browser-specific features, run the Playwright suite.
    ```bash
    npx playwright test
    ```

## 3. Key Architectural Principles & Conventions

-   **Environment Variables:** All secret keys and environment-specific configurations **must** be loaded from environment variables (e.g., `import.meta.env.VITE_...`). Do **not** hardcode keys in the source code. The Jest environment is configured to use `.env.test` for its variables.
-   **Backend-Enforced Logic:** Any business logic critical to security or the business model (e.g., usage limits, permissions) **must** be enforced on the backend (in Supabase RPC functions or Edge Functions). Do not rely on client-side checks for security.
-   **Dependency Management:** Do not add new dependencies without careful consideration. Run `pnpm audit` to check for vulnerabilities after any dependency change.
-   **Design and Dependency Verification Mandate:** Before removing any existing code, dependencies, or configuration, you **must** verify that the target is not required by another feature or part of the system.
    -   **Procedure:**
        1.  **Consult Documentation:** Review `PRD.md` and `System Architecture.md` to understand the full scope of the product's features.
        2.  **Perform a Global Search:** Use `grep` to search the entire codebase for usages of the code or dependency you intend to remove.
        3.  **Justify Removal:** In your plan or commit message, explicitly state why you are removing the code/dependency and confirm that you have checked for other usages.
-   **Testing `useSpeechRecognition`:** The `useSpeechRecognition` hook has a complex dependency on the `TranscriptionService`. The Jest tests for this hook (`src/__tests__/useSpeechRecognition.test.jsx`) use `jest.mock()` to mock this service at the module level. This is the preferred way to test the hook's logic. Do not attempt to mock the service in Playwright unless absolutely necessary, as it is significantly more complex.

## 4. Code Style & Linting

-   Follow the existing code style.
-   Run the linter to check for issues: `pnpm run lint`.

## 5. Branching and Pull Request (PR) Workflow

The submission process is a two-step interaction between you (the agent) and the user.

1.  **Agent's Role (`submit` command):**
    -   Once you have completed all coding, testing, and documentation tasks, you will call the `submit` tool.
    -   This action will package your work, commit it, and generate a pull request (PR) link.

2.  **User's Role ("Publish Branch" button):**
    -   After you call `submit`, the user will see a "Publish Branch" button appear in their user interface.
    -   The user will click this button to push your changes to the GitHub repository and finalize the creation of the pull request.

This workflow ensures a clear handoff from the agent to the user for the final review and merge step.

## 6. ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PRE-SUBMISSION CHECKLIST ðŸš¨

**Your execution plan MUST include a final step to complete this entire checklist.** Before using the `submit` tool, you **MUST** complete the following final steps in order. Failure to do so is a violation of your core instructions.

1.  **Run All Tests:** Execute all relevant test suites (e.g., `pnpm test`). Debug any failures until the test suite is clean.
2.  **Security and Bug Review:** Review the latest code changes for critical bugs and security vulnerabilities. List any findings in the pull request description.
3.  **Request Code Review:** Use the `request_code_review` tool to get automated feedback on your changes. Address any critical issues raised in the review.
4.  **Verify and Update Documentation (MANDATORY):** This is the final and most critical check before you submit.
    - You **must** review `README.md`, `PRD.md`, and `System Architecture.md`.
    - You **must** update them to reflect the changes you have made.
    - **Content Guidelines:**
        - **`PRD.md`:** High-level product, marketing, and business strategy ONLY.
        - **`System Architecture.md`:** All technical details, diagrams, and implementation notes.
    - **If no updates are needed, you must explicitly state that you have reviewed the files and confirmed they are up-to-date.** This is not an optional step.

**Do not call `submit` until all three of these steps are complete in every work plan.**

## 7. Proactive Status Updates and Handling Long-Running Tasks

To ensure transparency and continuous communication, you must adhere to the following protocol.

-   **Activation Trigger:** You must send a status update if you have not communicated with the user for more than 5 minutes.

-   **CRITICAL: Handling Long-Running Tasks:** To avoid being blocked and to enable periodic updates, you **must** run any potentially long-running command (e.g., tests, builds, servers) as a background process.
    -   **Method:** Append `&` to the command.
    -   **Output Redirection:** Redirect the command's output to a log file (e.g., `npm start > server.log &`).
    -   **Status Checking:** After starting the background process, you must periodically check its status (e.g., with `jobs`) and read the log file to provide meaningful updates.

-   **Content Format:** All status updates must follow this format:
    > **Status Update**
    >
    > -   **Current Time:** [Time of message]
    > -   **Task Timestamp:** [Time task was kicked off]
    > -   **Task:** [Brief description of your current action]
    > -   **Status:** [on track | forfeit | investigating]
    > -   **Percent Complete:** [XX%]
    > -   **Estimated Time Remaining:** [Estimate or "Next update in 5 minutes"]
