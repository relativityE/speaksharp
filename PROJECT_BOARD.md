# SpeakSharp Project Board
This board provides a two-dimensional view of our project tasks, combining Phased Milestones (timeline) with MoSCoW Prioritization.

Status Key: âœ… Done | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | ðŸ”´ Not Started

## Phase 1: Stabilize & Harden the MVP
This phase focuses on fixing critical bugs, addressing code health, and ensuring the existing features are reliable and robust.

### ðŸŽ¯ Must-Have
- ðŸ”´ **Implement On-Device 'Local Transcript' Mode:** Implement a fully on-device, privacy-first transcription mode for Pro users.
  - ðŸ”´ 1. Research & Select Model: Choose a suitable on-device speech recognition model (e.g., from Transformers.js) that balances performance and accuracy.
  - ðŸ”´ 2. Create LocalWhisper Provider: Build a new provider class within the TranscriptionService that conforms to the existing service interface.
  - ðŸ”´ 3. Integrate Model & Audio Processing: Implement the logic to load the selected model into the provider and process audio chunks locally.
  - ðŸ”´ 4. Add UI Selector: Create a UI control for Pro users to select the 'Local Transcript' mode.
  - ðŸ”´ 5. E2E Testing & Hardening: Write comprehensive tests and harden the feature for production use.
- ðŸ”´ **Harden and Polish the Native Transcription Experience:** Improve the reliability and UX of the default NativeBrowser (cloud) mode.
- âœ… **Implement Conditional Rendering for Missing Env Vars:** The app should not crash if environment variables are missing, but instead show a graceful "offline" or "configuration needed" state.
- ðŸ”´ **Add structured logging:** Implement for both frontend and backend to improve debuggability.
- ðŸŸ¡ **Update E2E tests for v3 transcription flow:** This is blocked by a critical rendering failure in the Playwright environment.
- ðŸ”´ **Add full unit test coverage for `CloudAssemblyAI.js`:** Target â‰¥80% coverage for core logic.
- âœ… Fix cloud transcription connection: Use correct v3 endpoint and handle raw PCM audio instead of JSON.
- âœ… Fix data flow race condition: Ensure session data is saved before navigation.
- âœ… Fix state management & navigation bugs: Resolved issues in the session page.
- âœ… Stabilize the Vitest test suite: All unit tests now pass without warnings. (Note: A memory leak currently prevents coverage runs, and 4 tests are skipped.)
- âœ… Fix CSS Build Process & Styling: Resolved a cascade of issues including incompatible build plugins, incorrect dependencies, and a disconnected theme.
- âœ… Reinstate session saving & analytics: Ensure new v3 transcripts are stored correctly.

### ðŸš§ Should-Have (Tech Debt)
- ðŸ”´ **Fix Test Suite Environment:** A parent task to investigate and fix the root causes of the test suite's instability.
  - ðŸ”´ 1. Resolve Test Runner Hangs: Debug and fix the issue causing pnpm test to hang indefinitely.
  - ðŸ”´ 2. Resolve Vitest Caching Issues: Identify and fix the severe caching problem that prevents updated test files from being executed.
  - ðŸ”´ 3. Fix Skipped Tests: Address the underlying issues and re-enable the tests for CloudAssemblyAI, SessionSidebar, useSpeechRecognition, and AnalyticsPage.
- âœ… Improve toast notification styling: Toasts are now pill-shaped with appropriate styling.
- âœ… Improve loading/waiting state feedback: The transcript panel now provides clearer UI feedback.
- âœ… Add Page-Level Render Tests: Create a test for each main page (Home, Session, Analytics, Auth) to verify it renders without crashing.
- ðŸ”´ **Create Troubleshooting Guide:** Add error recovery steps to the documentation.

### Gating Check
- ðŸ”´ **Bring all documentation up to date to reflect latest/current code implementation**
- ðŸ”´ **Do a Gap Analysis of current implementation against the Current Phase requirements.**

## Phase 2: User Validation & Polish
This phase is about confirming the core feature set works as expected and polishing the user experience before wider release.

### ðŸŽ¯ Must-Have
- âœ… **Explicit Mode Indication in UI:** The UI must be unambiguously clear about which transcription mode (Native vs. Cloud vs. Local) is active at all times.
- ðŸ”´ **User-Friendly Error Handling:** Implement specific, user-facing error messages for common issues (e.g., WebSocket disconnects, token failures).
- ðŸ”´ **Deploy & confirm live transcript UI works:** Ensure text appears within 2 seconds of speech in a live environment.
- ðŸ”´ **Remove all temporary console.logs:** Clean up the codebase for production.
- âœ… Implement Universal Navigation: Add a consistent, mobile-first sidebar navigation accessible from all pages.
- âœ… Implement Analytics Page UI Components: Add the session status box and a developer checkbox for forcing cloud AI.

### ðŸš§ Should-Have (Tech Debt)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Implement new SpeakSharp Design System:**
  - âœ… 1. Configure Core Theme & Test
  - âœ… 2. Create Component Plugins & Test
  - ðŸŸ¡ 3. Refactor UI Components & Test
  - ðŸ”´ 4. Final Verification & Test
- âœ… **Add Robust UX States:** For error, loading, and empty transcript scenarios.
- ðŸ”´ **Improve Accessibility:** Use an ARIA live region for the transcript so screen readers can announce new lines.
- ðŸ”´ **Add Deno unit tests for the token endpoint:** Ensure the assemblyai-token function is fully covered.
- ðŸ”´ **Add a soak test:** Create a test that runs for 1-minute with continuous audio to check for memory leaks or hangs.

### Gating Check
- ðŸ”´ **Bring all documentation up to date to reflect latest/current code implementation**
- ðŸ”´ **Do a Gap Analysis of current implementation against the Current Phase requirements.**

## Phase 3: Extensibility & Future-Proofing
This phase focuses on long-term architecture, scalability, and preparing for future feature development.

### ðŸŽ¯ Must-Have
- ðŸ”´ **Implement WebSocket reconnect logic:** Add heartbeat and exponential backoff for a more resilient connection.
- âœ… Implement new CVA-based Design System: Establish a new, comprehensive design system for all UI components.
- âœ… Reintroduce TranscriptionService abstraction: Place both cloud and local modes behind a single, unified service layer.

### ðŸŒ± Could-Have (Future Enhancements)
- ðŸ”´ **Add a Jitter Buffer & Audio Resampling Guard:** To gracefully handle unstable microphone inputs.
- ðŸ”´ **Implement Stripe "Pro Mode" Flag:** For feature gating and usage-based billing.
- ðŸŸ¡ **Set up Multi-Env CI/CD:** With preview deployments for staging and production. (Note: A basic implementation for DB migrations exists.)

### Gating Check
- ðŸ”´ **Bring all documentation up to date to reflect latest/current code implementation**
- ðŸ”´ **Do a Gap Analysis of current implementation against the Current Phase requirements.**
