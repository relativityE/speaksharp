## 🎙️ Recording Best Practices

To get the most accurate analysis, follow these tips:

*   **Quiet Environment:** Minimize background noise (fans, air conditioning, distant chatter).
*   **Good Microphone:** While laptop mics work, a dedicated headset or USB microphone significantly improves transcription accuracy.
*   **Natural Pace:** Speak as you would in a real setting. Our AI is designed to handle natural conversational flow.
*   **Browser Selection:** For the best experience, we recommend using **Chrome** or **Edge**, which have superior built-in Speech Recognition support.

## 📊 Understanding Your Analytics

After every session, SpeakSharp provides a deep dive into your speaking patterns:

### 1. Clarity Score
A score from 0-100% based primarily on your filler word usage. 
*   **90%+**: Professional and polished.
*   **75-90%**: Good conversational clarity.
*   **Under 75%**: Consider slowing down and focusing on pausing instead of using "um" or "uh".

### 2. Speaking Pace (WPM)
*   **Slow (<110 WPM)**: May sound overly cautious or tentative.
*   **Ideal (110-150 WPM)**: The "Sweet Spot" for presentations and meetings.
*   **Fast (>160 WPM)**: Can be difficult for audiences to follow. Try adding more pauses.

### 3. Filler Word Analysis
We track "um", "uh", "like", "so", and "you know". Our **Top 2 Filler Words** indicator helps you identify your most frequent crutch words so you can intentionally phase them out.
