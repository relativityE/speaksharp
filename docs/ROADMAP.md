# SpeakSharp Roadmap
*(For executive-level commentary on prioritization, see [REVIEW.md](./REVIEW.md)).*

This document outlines the forward-looking development plan for SpeakSharp. Completed tasks are moved to the [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

Status Key: 游리 In Progress | 游댮 Not Started
---
## Phase 1: Stabilize & Harden the MVP
This phase focuses on fixing critical bugs, addressing code health, and ensuring the existing features are reliable and robust.

### 游뚾 Should-Have (Tech Debt)
- 游댮 **Refactor Integration Tests:** Slim down component tests (`SessionSidebar`, `AnalyticsPage`, etc.) to remove redundant coverage now handled by E2E tests.
- 游댮 **Create Troubleshooting Guide:** Add error recovery steps to the documentation.
- 游댮 **Harden Supabase Security:** Address security advisor warnings.
  - 游댮 1. Shorten OTP expiry to less than one hour.
  - 游댮 2. Enable leaked password protection.
  - 游댮 3. Upgrade the Postgres version.
- 游댮 **Diagnose the final "Start Session" button issue**:
    -   Analyze the `trace.zip` file from the last failed test run to understand the component state and console output at the moment of failure.
    -   Determine why the `SessionSidebar` component is not rendering the button for the test runner.
- 游댮 **Fix the remaining E2E tests**:
    -   The `auth.e2e.spec.ts` suite is not currently run by any Playwright project. This needs to be added.
    -   The test runner environment is unstable and frequently times out. This needs to be investigated and stabilized.

### Gating Check
- 游댮 **Do a Gap Analysis of current implementation against the Current Phase requirements.**

## Phase 2: User Validation & Polish
This phase is about confirming the core feature set works as expected and polishing the user experience before wider release.

### 游꿢 Must-Have
- 游댮 **Implement Speaking Pace Analysis:** Add real-time feedback on words per minute to the core analytics.
- 游댮 **Implement Custom Vocabulary:** Allow Pro users to add custom words (jargon, names) to improve transcription accuracy.
- 游댮 **Implement Speaker Identification:** Add the ability to distinguish between different speakers in the transcript.
- 游댮 **Implement Vocal Variety / Pause Detection:** Add a new Pro-tier feature to analyze vocal variety or pause duration.
- 游댮 **Add UI Selector for On-Device Mode:** Add a UI element to allow Pro users to select their preferred transcription mode.
- 游댮 **User-Friendly Error Handling:** Implement specific, user-facing error messages for common issues.
- 游댮 **Deploy & confirm live transcript UI works:** Ensure text appears within 2 seconds of speech in a live environment.
- 游댮 **Remove all temporary console.logs:** Clean up the codebase for production.

### 游뚾 Should-Have (Tech Debt)
- 游리 **Implement new SpeakSharp Design System:**
  - 游리 3. Refactor UI Components & Test
  - 游댮 4. Final Verification & Test
- 游리 **Add Robust UX States:** Some states exist, but are inconsistently applied.
- 游댮 **Improve Accessibility:** Use an ARIA live region for the transcript so screen readers can announce new lines.
- 游댮 **Add Deno unit tests for the token endpoint.**
- 游댮 **Add a soak test:** Create a test that runs for 1-minute with continuous audio to check for memory leaks or hangs.

### Gating Check
- 游댮 **Do a Gap Analysis of current implementation against the Current Phase requirements.**

---
## Phase 3: Extensibility & Future-Proofing
This phase focuses on long-term architecture, scalability, and preparing for future feature development.

### 游꿢 Must-Have
- 游댮 **Implement WebSocket reconnect logic:** Add heartbeat and exponential backoff for a more resilient connection.

### 游꺔 Could-Have (Future Enhancements)
- 游댮 **Implement Stripe "Pro Mode" Flag:** For feature gating and usage-based billing.
- 游댮 **Automate On-Device Model Updates:** Create a script (e.g., GitHub Action) to automatically check for and download new versions of the locally-hosted Whisper model to prevent it from becoming stale.
- 游댮 **Add Platform Integrations (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet):** Allow SpeakSharp to connect to and analyze audio from third-party meeting platforms.
- 游리 **Set up Multi-Env CI/CD:** A basic implementation for DB migrations exists, but needs expansion.

### Gating Check
- 游댮 **Do a Gap Analysis of current implementation against the Current Phase requirements.**

## Technical Debt

This section is a prioritized list of technical debt items to be addressed.

- **P1 (High): Add Unit Test Coverage for Core Features**
  - **Problem:** A new mandate requires unit tests for all features. The following are missing coverage:
    - **Transcription Modes:** `CloudAssemblyAI`, `LocalWhisper`, `NativeBrowser`.
    - **Session & Analytics:** `SessionContext`, `analyticsUtils` (for trend analysis).

- **P3 (Medium): Incomplete TypeScript Migration**
  - **Problem:** Several test-related files and utilities are still JavaScript.
  - **Files to migrate:** `__mocks__/*.js`, `src/services/transcription/utils/audio-processor.worklet.js`.

- **P4 (Low): Improve Unit Test Discoverability**
  - **Problem:** The lack of easily discoverable, co-located unit tests makes the codebase harder to maintain.
