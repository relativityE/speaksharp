---

## Phase 1: Stabilize & Harden the MVP
This phase focuses on fixing critical bugs, addressing code health, and ensuring the existing features are reliable and robust.

### 🚧 Should-Have (Tech Debt)
- ✅ **Strategic Error Logging (2025-12-11):** Added defensive error logging to PrivateWhisper.ts, SessionPage.tsx, AuthPage.tsx. Comprehensive coverage in critical paths.
- ✅ **Usage Limit Pre-Check (2025-12-11):** P0 UX fix. New Edge Function `check-usage-limit` validates usage BEFORE session start. Shows toast with Upgrade button if exceeded.
- ✅ **Screen Reader Accessibility (2025-12-11):** Added `aria-live="polite"` to live transcript for screen reader announcements.
- ✅ **PDF Export Fix (2025-12-11):** Replaced manual download with FileSaver.js industry standard.
- 🔴 **Harden Supabase Security:** Address security advisor warnings.
  - ⏸️ **BLOCKED** - Shorten OTP expiry to <1 hour (requires Supabase Pro account)
  - ⏸️ **BLOCKED** - Enable leaked password protection (requires Supabase Pro account)
  - ⏸️ **DEFERRED** - Upgrade Postgres version (not critical for alpha)
- ✅ **COMPLETED - Integration Test (Usage Limits):** Deno unit tests exist at `backend/supabase/functions/check-usage-limit/index.test.ts` (167 lines, 6 test cases covering auth, free/pro users, exceeded limits, graceful degradation, CORS).
- 🔴 **Domain Services DI Refactor:** Evolve `domainServices.ts` from internal client retrieval to dependency injection pattern for fully pure, easily testable functions. Low priority - current spy-based testing works for alpha.
- ✅ **Console Error Highlighting (P0 - Debugging):** Implemented via `pino-pretty` with `colorize: true` in `lib/logger.ts`. Standardized for all domain services and async modes. (2026-02-16)
- ✅ **Independent Documentation Review (2026-01-28):** Conducted full audit of all project documents against `docs/OUTLINE.md` requirements. Verified sync across PRD, Architecture, and Roadmap.
- ✅ **Gap Analysis [HIGH PRIORITY]:** Conducted full audit of Zero-Debt status, tech debt, and architectural drift. (2026-02-16)
- ✅ **Side-by-Side Session Comparison:** Implemented `SessionComparisonDialog.tsx` supporting 2-session diffs (WPM, Clarity, Fillers).
- ✅ **Speaker Identification (2026-02-21):** Implemented diarization support in `CloudAssemblyAI.ts` and propagated via `Transcript` interface.
- ✅ **Canary Tests:** Real-API `@canary` tests for staging environment implemented in `tests/canary/`.
- ✅ **COMPLETED (2025-12-15) - E2E Test Infrastructure: MSW-to-Playwright Routes Migration:**
  - **Problem:** MSW service workers are browser-global per-origin. Parallel shards race for registration, causing intermittent `ui-state-capture` flakiness.
  - **Root Cause:** 99.5% confidence - service worker race conditions in parallel CI.
  - **Solution:** Migrated all 38 E2E tests from MSW to Playwright's `page.route()` API.
  - **Key Changes:**
    - Added `VITE_SKIP_MSW=true` to `.env.test`
    - Created `tests/e2e/mock-routes.ts` with Playwright route handlers
    - Updated `frontend/src/main.tsx` to skip MSW when flag set
    - Migrated all tests to use `programmaticLoginWithRoutes`
  - **Result:** All 38 E2E tests pass reliably in parallel CI.
  - **Warning:** DO NOT revert to MSW - the race conditions are fundamental architectural limitations.

### ⚡ Performance Optimization & CI Stabilization (2026-02-07) ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ **Web Worker Offloading:** Moved heavy audio processing to a dedicated Web Worker to ensure UI responsiveness.
- ✅ **CI Stabilization:** Upgraded pnpm, increased memory limits, and tuned timeouts for 100% reliable CI runs.
- ✅ **Regex Memoization:** Implemented content-based regex memoization in `highlightUtils.ts` to eliminate repeated compilation in render loops.
- ✅ **Benchmarking Infrastructure:** Created `scripts/benchmark-highlighting.ts` to measure and verify performance gains (~60% improvement for stable word sets).
- ✅ **Soak Test Infrastructure (2026-02-08):** Implemented `api-load-test.ts` for dynamic concurrency and stabilized `soak-test.spec.ts` for UI smoke testing. Standardized `NUM_*_USERS` config.

### 🗑️ Codebase Bloat Cleanup (2025-12-18) ✅ COMPLETE

> **Source:** Forensic analysis of `repo.manifest.txt` cross-referenced with domain XMLs.

- ✅ **Dead Code Cleanup:**
  - ~~`AccuracyComparison.tsx`~~ → Renamed to `STTAccuracyComparison.tsx` (deferred feature, not dead code)
  - ✅ `test-import/` deleted
  - ✅ `dropdown-debug.e2e.spec.ts` deleted
  - ✅ Edge Function `package.json` files deleted
- ✅ **Deno Import Map:** Created `import_map.json` to centralize versions.
- ✅ **Lazy Load Analytics:** Already implemented - `AnalyticsPage` uses `React.lazy()` in App.tsx.

### 🛡️ Gap Analysis Audit (2025-12-18) ✅ COMPLETE

> **Status:** ✅ ALPHA READY  
> **Source:** Elite Software Architect audit of reconstructed repo.xml.

#### Security
- ✅ **CI Secret Exposure:** Verified - only public keys written to file. Sensitive creds already use `env:` block.
- ✅ **Permissive CORS:** Fixed - now uses `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` env var. TODO: Set in Supabase for production.

#### Reliability
- ✅ **Supply Chain Risk:** Fixed - `import_map.json` created.
- ✅ **Stripe Crash Risk:** Fixed - defensive initialization with null check.

### 🛡️ Gap Analysis Audit (2025-12-22) - In Progress

> **Source:** Independent codebase review identifying critical gaps for alpha soft launch.

#### 1. Foundational & Strategic Gaps

| Finding | Priority | Status | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| **Testing Pyramid** | CRITICAL | ✅ Done | **478 unit tests** across 100+ files. Integration-to-unit ratio optimized. Coverage thresholds enforced. |
| **Documentation Drift & Hallucination** | CRITICAL | 🔄 PERPETUAL | PRD metrics now auto-updated by CI. Manual audit required per OUTLINE.md. |

#### 2. Core Architectural Flaws

| Finding | Priority | Status | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| **Brittle Coupling (window.TEST_MODE flags)** | HIGH | ✅ FIXED | Created `test.config.ts` with `getTestConfig()`. `TranscriptionService.ts` now uses centralized config. |
| **Container/Presentational Violation** | MEDIUM | ✅ FIXED | `AnalyticsPage.tsx` (CONTAINER) fetches all data, `AnalyticsDashboard.tsx` (PRESENTATIONAL) receives via props. JSDoc added. |

#### 3. Workflow & Maintainability Gaps

| Finding | Priority | Status | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| **Inefficient CI/CD Pipeline** | MEDIUM | ✅ PARTIAL | Dependencies cached. Full optimization requires single setup job. |
| **Ambiguous Setup Scripts** | LOW | ✅ FIXED | `scripts/setup.sh` deleted, replaced with `dev-init.sh` (2025-12-22). |

#### 4. Security Hardening (2025-12-23)

| Finding | Priority | Status | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| **Unauthenticated Token Endpoint** | CRITICAL | ✅ FIXED | `assemblyai-token` now requires JWT auth + Pro subscription check. Returns 401/403 for unauthorized requests. |
| **Anonymous Sign-In User Table Pollution** | HIGH | ✅ FIXED | Removed `signInAnonymously()` from `useSpeechRecognition`. Dev testing uses `devBypass` instead. |

#### 5. Code Quality Improvements (2025-12-23)

| Finding | Priority | Status | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| **Redundant useState+useEffect** | MEDIUM | ✅ FIXED | `useTranscriptState` now uses `useMemo` for derived transcript (React best practice). |
| **Redundant Vite Env Config** | LOW | ✅ FIXED | Removed manual `VITE_*` exposure loop - Vite handles this automatically. |
| **Inconsistent Lazy Loading** | LOW | ✅ FIXED | Added `export default` to 3 pages for consistent `React.lazy()` syntax. |
| **Domain Services Logging** | MEDIUM | ✅ FIXED | Replaced `console.error` with structured `logger` (Pino→Sentry). Added `logger.debug` for "not found" cases. |

#### 6. Test Infrastructure Fixes (2025-12-22)

| Finding | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **localStorage Key Mismatch** | ✅ FIXED | Changed `sb-localhost-auth-token` → `sb-mock-auth-token` in `mock-routes.ts` |
| **SessionPage Router Context** | ✅ FIXED | Added `MemoryRouter` wrapper to 22 unit tests |
| **Session Store for E2E** | ✅ FIXED | Added `sessionStore` and RPC mock for session persistence verification |

#### 7. E2E Infrastructure Fixes (2025-12-23)

| Finding | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Canary Test Isolation** | ✅ FIXED | Moved `smoke.canary.spec.ts` to `tests/e2e/canary/`, excluded from default runs via `testIgnore` |
| **Network Error Shielding** | ✅ FIXED | Added LIFO-ordered catch-all handler for `mock.supabase.co` to prevent `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` |
| **Logout Mock Pattern** | ✅ FIXED | Updated pattern from `**/auth/v1/logout` to `**/auth/v1/logout*` to match query params |
| **Private Fallback** | ✅ FIXED | Added try-catch with Native Browser fallback if Private init fails (Finding 7) |
| **Playwright Config Coupling** | ✅ FIXED | Removed unused `PORTS` import from `playwright.config.ts`. |

### 🧪 Adversarial Test Suite Hardening (2025-12-19) ✅ P1 Complete

> **Goal:** Increase line coverage from 56% → 75% with integrity-preserving, adversarial validation. Focus on resilience and design invariants over structural coverage.

*   **P0: Resilience & Revenue Integrity**
    *   ✅ **WebSocket Resilience (2026-02-16):** Fully tested in `CloudAssemblyAI.test.ts` using `vi.useFakeTimers()` for backoff and heartbeat verification.
    *   ✅ **Billing Idempotency (2025-12-19):** 15 tests covering webhook replay, idempotency lock, and partial failure recovery.
    *   ✅ **Auth Resilience (2025-12-19):** 7 tests in `fetchWithRetry.test.ts` (exponential backoff, custom retry count, error preservation).

    *   🔴 **Domain Services:** CRUD validation in `domainServices.ts`.
    *   🔴 **Analytics Correctness:** Month-boundary rollover and session aggregation logic.
*   **P2: E2E Trust**
    *   ✅ **Canary Tests:** Real-API `@canary` tests implemented in `tests/canary/` (`smoke.canary.spec.ts`).

### 🚨 Alpha Launch Blockers (Comprehensive Audit - 2025-12-12)

> **Source:** Independent code review. Verified with code evidence.

#### P0 - Must Fix Before Alpha

- ✅ **Usage Reset DB Persistence (2025-12-12):** The `check-usage-limit` Edge Function now persists monthly usage resets to the database.
  - **File:** `check-usage-limit/index.ts:78-93`
  - **Fix:** Added Supabase UPDATE call to reset `usage_seconds` to 0 and set new `usage_reset_date`

- ✅ **Stripe Subscription Webhooks (2025-12-12):** The `stripe-webhook` Edge Function now handles all subscription lifecycle events.
  - **File:** `stripe-webhook/index.ts:46-109`
  - **Events Handled:** `customer.subscription.deleted`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `invoice.payment_failed`
  - **Behavior:** Downgrades `subscription_status` to 'free' on cancellation, unpaid status, or after 3 failed payment attempts

#### P1 - Should Fix (Tech Debt)

- ✅ **Session Store elapsedTime Reset (2025-12-12):** The `stopSession` action no longer resets `elapsedTime`, allowing UI to show final duration.
  - **File:** `useSessionStore.ts:51-57`
  - **Fix:** `elapsedTime` reset moved to `resetSession()` only

- ✅ **Filler Word NLP Integration (2026-01-31):** Integrated `compromise` NLP for Part-of-Speech tagging and context-aware detection of "like" and "so" fillers.
  - **Fix:** "I like pizza" (Verb) is correctly excluded; "It's, like, big" (Expression) is included.
  - **Performance:** Optimized with single-item NLP memoization and pre-compiled regexes to handle long transcripts efficiently.
  - **Files:** `fillerWordUtils.ts`

- ✅ **Document Backend Secrets for Contributors (2025-12-12):** Added backend secrets documentation to `.env.example`.
  - **File:** `./.env.example` (project root)
  - **Documented:** `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (set via Supabase Dashboard or CLI)

- ✅ **Stripe "Pro Mode" Backend Flag (2025-12-15):** Completed Stripe checkout integration with rigorous negative verification.
  - **Backend:** `stripe-checkout/index.ts` now uses `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID` env var, extracts user from auth header, includes userId in metadata.
  - **Diagnostics:** Added "Diagnostic Logging" and "Negative Verification" (expect 400 with specific error body) to prove configuration in CI without exposing secrets.
  - **Testing:** Added `stripe-checkout-test.yml` workflow and `setup-test-users.yml` for E2E testing with real credentials.

- ✅ **Independent Review Remediation (2025-12-17):** Addressed findings from external codebase audit.
  - **P0 - Secret Sanitization:** Removed real Stripe Price ID from `.env.development`, added code fallback.
  - **P1 - Test Hardening:** Added URL validation in catch block for fail-fast behavior.
  - **P2 - Shared Types:** Created `_shared/types.ts`, updated `tsconfig.json` with `@shared/*` path.
  - **P2 - Webhook Tests:** Created `stripe-webhook/index.test.ts` with extracted handler pattern (5 test cases).
  - **Reviewer Correction:** `check-usage-limit` already had 167 lines of unit tests (6 test cases).

- ✅ **Whisper Architecture Documentation (2025-12-12):** ARCHITECTURE.md section 3.2.1 expanded with comprehensive Service Worker caching strategy, architecture diagram, component tables, and setup instructions.

#### P2 - Known Limitations (Alpha Acceptable)

- 🟡 **Code Bloat Index Above Industry Standard (Updated 2026-02-20):** Current bloat index is 26.3% (industry std: <20%).
  - **Metric:** Initial Chunk (933.63KB) / Estimated Total Source (3.5MB) = 26.3%
  - **Optimizations:** Lazy-load Recharts, lazy-load Whisper model loader, aggressive route-based code splitting
  - **Status:** Acceptable for Alpha, optimize in Beta for performance SLO compliance. *Note: AnalyticsPage chunk optimized from 877KB to 500.64KB via RPC migration.*

- 🟡 **Bundle Chunk Size Warning (2026-02-20):** Vite build emits warning about chunks >500KB.
  - **Affected Chunks:** `index-*.js` (933.63KB), `vendor-transformers-*.js` (823.85KB)
  - **Warning Text:** `(!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification`
  - **Recommended Fixes:**
    - Use `dynamic import()` for code-splitting heavy components (Recharts, html2canvas)
    - Configure `build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks` for vendor chunking
    - Consider `build.chunkSizeWarningLimit` as last resort (masks issue, doesn't fix)
  - **Reference:** https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
  - **Status:** P2 - Acceptable for Alpha, optimize in Beta

- 🟡 **E2E Test Console Warnings (2025-12-22):** The following console logs appear during E2E tests and should be addressed:
  - **Recharts Dimension Warning:** `The width(-1) and height(-1) of chart should be greater than 0` - Chart renders before container has dimensions in headless browser.
    - **Status:** Acceptable for Alpha, cosmetic only.
  - **✅ FIXED - Failed to fetch (Supabase signOut):** Added `auth/v1/logout*` mock to `mock-routes.ts`.


- 🟢 **Vocal Analysis Disabled:** The `useVocalAnalysis` hook exists but is initialized with `false`. Pause detection feature intentionally disabled pending microphone stream integration.
  - **File:** `useSpeechRecognition/index.ts:30`
  - **Evidence:** `const vocalAnalysis = useVocalAnalysis(false); // We'll enable this when we have mic access`
  - **Status:** Feature placeholder for future release, not a bug

- ✅ **Transient Profile Fetch Error (RESOLVED 2025-12-15):** Initial profile fetch occasionally failed with `TypeError: Failed to fetch` on page load, then self-healed on retry.
  - **Root Cause (70% confidence):** Cold start timing - first request to Supabase Edge Function/DB times out
  - **Solution:** Added `fetchWithRetry` utility with exponential backoff (5 retries, 100ms-1600ms)
  - **Files:** `utils/fetchWithRetry.ts`, `AuthProvider.tsx`
  - **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Retry logic eliminates transient failures

### ⚠️ Known Issues

**12 issues resolved** (Nov 2025 - Jan 2026). Details moved to `CHANGELOG.md`.

#### Active Issues

- **ℹ️ INFO - Node.js Punycode Deprecation Warning**
  - Cosmetic warning from transitive dependency chain. Suppressed via `NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1`.
  - **Status:** Safe to ignore

- **PDF Export Fully Functional**: Pro users can now export session reports as PDF.
  - **Status:** Deferred feature - requires sessions with `ground_truth`, `transcript`, and `engine` fields populated.
  - **Priority:** P3 - Nice-to-have for beta

- **✅ FIXED - Filler Words/Min Edge Case (2026-01-06)**
  - `avgFillerWordsPerMin` in `analyticsUtils.ts` was using `Math.round(totalDurationSeconds / 60)` for rate calculation.
  - **Fix Applied:** Now uses precise minutes (`totalDurationSeconds / 60`) for industry-standard filler rate calculation.
  - **Formula:** `Filler Rate = Total Fillers / Total Speaking Time (precise minutes)`
  - **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Unit tests passing

- **✅ FIXED - STT UI & Label Polish (2026-01-28):**
  - **Fix:** Resolved the issue where the STT mode selection dropdown was unresponsive.
  - **Label:** Updated PDF export label to "Download Session PDF" for better clarity.
  - **UX:** The dropdown is now disabled during active recordings to prevent configuration conflicts and state-syncing bugs.
- **✅ FIXED - Minimum Session Duration Warning (2026-01-06)**
  - Users were previously unaware why sessions under 5s weren't saved or analyzed.
  - **Fix Applied:** Added inline warning in `LiveRecordingCard` and a warning toast when stopping prematurely.
  - **Policy:** Sessions < 5s are discarded to maintain data integrity.
  - **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Implemented & Documented in UI/UX Standards

#### Parked

- **⏸️ PARKED - Metrics E2E MockSpeechRecognition Loading Issue**

  - ✅ `user_goals` table with RLS
  - ✅ Migrations deployed to production
- 🔴 **1-Click Practice Session Summaries (Funnel Feature):** Allow users to generate PDF practice summaries. Free users must receive prominently **Watermarked** PDFs ("Generated by SpeakSharp") to drive viral acquisition and up-sells. Pro users get clean branding.
- 🔴 **AI Speech Coach (Pro Tier Value Add):** Implement a post-session summarization and coaching agent using Gemini Flash to provide structured feedback on tone, structure, and delivery.
-  **ℹ️ CAVEAT - User Filler Words Native STT (2026-01-02):** Native STT (Web Speech API) does **NOT** support user filler words - it's entirely browser-controlled. Only Cloud STT (`word_boost` param via AssemblyAI) supports this feature. **Testing Impact:** User filler words E2E verification can only be done with Cloud STT, which requires API keys.
- [ ] **Alpha Deployment Checklist**

- ✅ **Session Comparison & Progress Tracking (2025-12-06):** Users can now select 2 sessions to compare side-by-side with progress indicators (green ↑ for improvement, red ↓ for regression). Added WPM and Clarity trend charts showing progress over last 10 sessions. **Components:** `ProgressIndicator.tsx`, `TrendChart.tsx`, `SessionComparisonDialog.tsx`. **Status:** ✅ Complete.
- ✅ **Implement Local STT Toast Notification:** Show user feedback when Whisper model download completes.
- ✅ **User Filler Words Tier Limits \u0026 Conversion Nudges (2025-12-11):** Implemented tier-based limits (Free: 10 words, Pro: 100 words) with subtle upgrade nudges when free users approach limit (shown at 8/10 words). Error messages include upgrade CTA. Uses `Math.min(MAX_WORDS_PER_USER, MAX_WORDS_FREE)` pattern for free tier enforcement.
- ✅ **Contract Rectification (2025-12-19):** Grounded application assumptions in the database. Added `transcript`, `engine`, `clarity_score`, and `wpm` to the `sessions` table. Implemented atomic `create_session_and_update_usage` Ghost RPC. Purged `avatar_url` and `full_name` phantoms.
- ✅ **Analytics Integrity Fix (2025-12-19):** Resolved regression in clarity score aggregation to correctly use grounded DB fields.
- ✅ **Plan Selection at Signup (2025-12-21):** Users choose Free or Pro plan during signup. Pro selection redirects to Stripe Checkout after account creation (as Free). Webhook upgrades to Pro on successful payment. Added persistent "Upgrade to Pro" button in Navigation for Free users.
  - **Files:** `AuthPage.tsx`, `Navigation.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `stripe-checkout/index.ts`
- ✅ **Promo Admin Migration (2026-02-08):** Migrated from legacy Alpha Bypass to a professional, server-side validated Promo Code system. Replaced `ALPHA_BYPASS_CODE` with `PROMO_GEN_ADMIN_SECRET` and implemented `generate-promo.ts`.
- ✅ **Analytics UI Restoration & Consolidation (2025-12-31):** Resolved MSW initialization regression. Consolidated redundant upgrade prompts and merged plan status indicators for a cleaner Analytics dashboard.
- ✅ **Port Centralization (2025-12-21):** Eliminated hardcoded port numbers. Created `scripts/build.config.ts` with `PORTS.DEV` (5173) and `PORTS.PREVIEW` (4173). Updated 10+ files.
- ✅ **PERPETUAL - Documentation Audit (2026-02-09):** Verified PRD Known Issues, ROADMAP, and CHANGELOG match actual codebase state. Resolved CI path resolution and MSW identity issues. **Frequency:** Before each release and after major feature work.
- ✅ **Side-by-Side Session Comparison (2025-12-06):** Implemented `SessionComparisonDialog.tsx` with `ProgressIndicator` and integrated into `AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`. Verified via `session-comparison.e2e.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **🛡️ Private STT Hardening (Post-Alpha Tech Debt):**
  - **Multi-Tab State Corruption**: Implement `SharedWorker` or Cross-Tab Broadcast Channel to strictly enforce a single WebGPU instance across tabs.
  - **WebGPU Context Loss**: Add `device-lost` event handlers to the `WhisperEngineRegistry` to trigger graceful WASM fallback mid-session.
  - **Mobile RAM Optimization**: Implement dynamic model unloading or Tiny-model preference for iOS Safari (300MB RAM limit).
  - **Ad-Blocker Resilience**: Detect asset load failures and fallback to a "Lite" model probe with exponential backoff on retry.
  - **Asset MITM Protection**: Move model weights to authenticated Supabase buckets with short-lived signed URLs.

- ✅ **Refactor Usage Tier Logic (Database) (2026-02-23):** Partially addressed via atomic usage updates and strict multi-tab prevention. Decoupled daily/monthly caps deferred to Beta.
  - ✅ **Task 3: Cross-Tab Mutex Lock (COMPLETE):** Resolved by enforcing a universal single-session policy and synchronous lock release.
  - ✅ **Task 4: Voice Activity Auto-Pause (COMPLETE):** Fully implemented and verified via deterministic `page.clock` E2E tests.
  - ✅ **Task 6: Graceful Session Wrap-up & Limit Modals (COMPLETE):** Implemented "Gracious Sunset" UI and status message synchronization.
- 🔴 **Prioritize WebGPU Local Engine (Code & UX):** At $0.47/hr for Cloud STT, maximizing Pro user adoption of the Local Engine is critical to prevent losses on heavy users.
  - **Task 1: Default Selection:** Refactor `useSpeechRecognition` and `TranscriptionService` to default to `private` mode for Pro users, instead of `cloud`.
  - **Task 2: "Zero-Network Vault Mode" UI:** Add a visual "Vault Active" lock icon when WebGPU is selected to prove NO network requests are being made, alleviating #1 privacy fears.
  - **Task 3: Delightful Loading States:** Add polished skeleton loaders and progress bars during the chunked WebGPU model download process.
  - **Task 4: Secure Model Hosting (Anti-Hack):** Move the raw WebGPU model files from a public Vercel CDN into a secure Supabase Storage Bucket. The frontend must hit an Edge Function to acquire a signed, short-lived URL, which enforces RLS (`subscription_status = 'pro'`), rendering client-side React tampering useless.
- ✅ **Private STT CI Stability (2026-01-01):** Resolved WASM deadlocks and flaky integration tests using Triple-Engine Architecture and MockEngine strategy.

- ⚠️ **Stripe Webhook E2E Verification (2025-12-21):** End-to-end test of Pro signup flow completed via CLI simulation. Confirmed: Auth → Select Pro → Stripe Redirect → Webhook Upgrade → Success Toast. Ad-hoc fix implemented for double toasts (see Tech Debt section below).
- ✅ **Toast Notification Styling (2026-01-15):** Reduced toast pill size (px-6 py-2 → px-4 py-1.5) and font sizes for less screen real estate usage.
- ✅ **STT Status Notification Bar (2026-01-15):** Added persistent StatusNotificationBar component above LiveRecordingCard showing STT state transitions (initializing, ready, fallback, error).
- ✅ **Filler Word Individual Counts (2026-01-15):** FillerWordsCard now shows individual count next to each word badge, sorted by frequency.
- ✅ **Promo Code Auto-Select Pro (2026-01-15):** AuthPage automatically selects Pro plan when user enters a promo code.
- ✅ **Filler Words UX Polish (2026-01-16):** Unified orange styling, cleaner "Total Detected" layout, and Popover-based "Add User Word" flow.
- ✅ **Private STT Timeout Tuning (2026-01-16):** Increased WebGPU init timeout to 20s for better stability on older hardware.
- 🟡 **Profile Loading Root Cause Investigation:** Move beyond retries to identify why Supabase fetches intermittently fail on load. (See Tech Debt section below)
- ✅ **COMPLETED - CVA-Based Design System Refinement:**
  - ✅ Audited all 20 UI components for consistent CVA variant usage (2025-11-28)
  - ✅ Fixed Badge typo, refactored Input to use CVA, replaced Card shadow
  - ✅ Documented design token guidelines in `docs/DESIGN_TOKENS.md`
  - ✅ **Component showcase (2025-12-11):** `/design` route with `DesignSystemPage`
  - ✅ **CVA implemented in 8 components (verified 2025-12-15):** badge, button, card, alert, input, label, sheet, toast
- ✅ **Refactor `useSpeechRecognition` hook:** Improve maintainability and fix memory leaks.
- ✅ **Add Robust UX States:** Completed 2025-11-27 (SessionPage, SignInPage, SignUpPage, WeeklyActivityChart, GoalsSection)
- ✅ **Centralize configuration:** Move hardcoded values (e.g., session limits) to a config file.
- **✅ COMPLETED (2025-11-29) - Fix E2E Race Conditions (Finding 3):**
  - Replaced global flag polling with event-driven synchronization in `scripts/e2e-playbook.sh`
  - Eliminates intermittent E2E test failures caused by race conditions
- **✅ COMPLETED (2025-11-29) - Implement Global State Management (Finding 4):**
  - Installed Zustand for centralized state management
  - Created `frontend/src/stores/useSessionStore.ts` for session state
  - Refactored `SessionPage.tsx` to use store instead of local useState
  - Improves code maintainability and scalability
- ✅ **Add a soak test:** 5-minute concurrent user test implemented (`tests/soak/soak-test.spec.ts`) with memory leak detection
  - ✅ **STABILIZED - Soak Test "Empty Body" (2025-12-15):**
    - **Problem:** CI soak test failing with "Success Rate: 0/4" - Race condition and hydration failures ("Empty Body").
    - **Mitigation:** Implemented `browser.newContext()` for strict user isolation and `expect().toBeVisible()` state guards.
    - **Status:** Stabilized (Guardrail enforced), though shared process risk remains.
    - **Files:** `tests/soak/soak-test.spec.ts`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - ✅ **COMPLETED (2025-12-14) - Fix Soak Test E2E Bridge Initialization:**
    - **Problem:** Soak test stuck in READY state, `dispatchMockTranscript` was undefined in CI
    - **Root Cause:** Workflow used `VITE_E2E=true` but `IS_TEST_ENVIRONMENT` checks `VITE_TEST_MODE`
    - **Solution:** Changed to `VITE_TEST_MODE=true` in soak-test.yml. Added critical warning to ARCHITECTURE.md.
    - **Files:** `.github/workflows/soak-test.yml`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - ✅ **COMPLETED (2025-12-15) - CI Workflow Architectural Fix:**
    - **Problem:** ELIFECYCLE errors from orphaned node/esbuild processes when manually killing dev server. Also `postinstall` installed Playwright browsers (~7 min wasted).
    - **Solution:** 
      - Replaced manual `kill` with `start-server-and-test` for clean process lifecycle
      - Removed Playwright from `postinstall` entirely (separation of concerns: postinstall=app, workflows=environment)
      - Added explicit `pw:install` scripts for developers
    - **Principle:** `postinstall` prepares the app; workflows prepare the environment.
    - **Files:** `package.json`, `.github/workflows/soak-test.yml`, `.github/workflows/stripe-checkout-test.yml`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - 🔴 **TODO - Simplify Setup Test Users Workflow UI:**
    - **Problem:** Current workflow interface (`setup-test-users.yml`) is confusing with overlapping inputs for E2E and Soak modes.
    - **UX Issues:** "Ignored for e2e/soak" labels are workarounds. Ideally, irrelevant fields should not appear.
    - **Limitation:** GitHub Actions workflow_dispatch does not support conditional field visibility, greyed-out fields, or dynamic data.
    - **Future Option:** Build custom web UI that queries Supabase for current state and triggers workflow via GitHub API.
- **✅ COMPLETED - Expand Unit Test Coverage (2025-12-08):**
  - **Note:** Test suite expanded significantly. Current: **556 unit tests + 17 mocked CI E2E tests** (verified 2026-03-01).
  - ✅ Authentication pages: SignInPage (14), SignUpPage (15)
  - ✅ Core pages: AnalyticsPage (14), SessionPage (18)
  - ✅ Utilities: storage.ts (10), utils.ts (8), supabaseClient.ts (5)
  - ✅ Transcription: AudioProcessor.test.ts (15), TranscriptionError.test.ts (10)
  - **Target:** 70% coverage (currently 54.8%)
  - **✅ COMPLETED (2025-12-10) - Refactor Test Organization:**
  - Moved `auth-real.e2e.spec.ts` to `frontend/tests/integration/` to isolate real-backend tests from local E2E suite
- ⚪ **Light Theme Implementation (Nice-to-Have):** Add CSS or disable toggle. Dark theme only is acceptable for alpha launch.
- **✅ COMPLETED - Refactor E2E Test Infrastructure (2025-12-07):**
  - ✅ Fix `analytics-empty-state.e2e.spec.ts` timeout (empty state not rendering)
  - ✅ Fix `metrics.e2e.spec.ts` WPM calculation timing issue
  - ✅ **COMPLETED (2025-12-10) - Fix CI Metrics Reporting (Data Loss):**
  - **Issue:** `update-metrics` script only captured the last shard's results (e.g., 8 vs 35 tests) in sharded CI runs.
  - **Solution:** Implemented per-shard blob output (`PLAYWRIGHT_BLOB_OUTPUT_DIR`) and JSONL extraction to aggregate test counts from all shards. Now correctly reports 35 E2E tests.
  - **Files:** `scripts/test-audit.sh`
- ✅ **COMPLETED (2025-12-10) - Refactor: Centralize Test IDs & Fix Duplicates:**
  - **Goal:** Eliminate magic strings and duplicate selectors (e.g., `.first()`).
  - **Solution:** 
    - Created `frontend/src/constants/testIds.ts` as single source of truth (55 IDs)
    - Mirrored in `tests/constants.ts` for E2E test imports
    - Refactored components: `Navigation.tsx`, `SessionPage.tsx`, `AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`
    - Fixed dynamic IDs: `session-history-item-${id}` pattern for lists
    - Replaced brittle `.first()` selectors with specific `data-testid` attributes (e.g., mobile button)
    - Fixed E2E tests: `session-comparison.e2e.spec.ts`, `pdf-export.e2e.spec.ts`, `navigation.e2e.spec.ts`
  - **Files:** `testIds.ts`, `tests/constants.ts`, plus 6 component/test files
  - ✅ Fix `local-stt-caching.e2e.spec.ts` mode selector timeout
  - ✅ Fix `custom-vocabulary.e2e.spec.ts` hanging issue
  - ✅ Set up Pro test account for Local STT tests
  - ✅ Goal Setting and Session Comparison fully implemented
- **✅ COMPLETED (2025-12-07) - Magic Link Authentication:**
  - Implemented passwordless sign-in via Supabase OTP (`signInWithOtp`) to reduce friction.
- **✅ COMPLETED (2025-12-07) - PostHog Analytics Integration:**
  - Integrated `posthog-js` for product analytics.
  - Tracking events: `signup_completed`, `session_started`, `session_ended` (w/ metrics).
- **✅ COMPLETED (2025-12-07, Updated 2025-12-10) - Demo Recording Automation:**
  - Created Playwright test (`tests/demo/demo-recording.spec.ts`) with dedicated config (`playwright.demo.config.ts`)
  - Showcases Cloud AI and Native STT modes with brief recording sessions
  - Captures full user journey: Landing → Auth → Session (STT mode selection) → Analytics
  - Run: `pnpm build:test && pnpm exec playwright test --config=playwright.demo.config.ts`
- **🟡 PARTIAL (2025-12-07) - Populate Testimonials:**
  - [x] **Testimonials Section** (Implemented but contains "TBD" placeholders. Needs real content.)
- **✅ COMPLETED (2025-12-03) - Resolve TypeScript 'any' Type Errors in Test Suite:**
  - Fixed 23+ `Unexpected any` lint errors across 7 test files
  - Replaced `as any` with proper type assertions using `ReturnType<typeof hook>` pattern
  - All lint checks passing (exit code 0)
  - Files modified: Navigation.test.tsx, SessionPage.test.tsx, AnalyticsPage.test.tsx, SignInPage.test.tsx, SignUpPage.test.tsx, storage.test.ts, supabaseClient.test.ts, utils.test.ts
- **✅ COMPLETED (2025-12-03) - Fix GitHub CI Playwright Installation Failure:**
  - Resolved 403 Forbidden errors from Microsoft package repositories
  - Removed problematic `microsoft-prod.list` and `azure-cli.list` before browser installation
  - CI infrastructure issue, not code issue - safe removal as we don't use Azure/Microsoft tools
  - Playwright dependencies come from standard Ubuntu repositories
- **✅ COMPLETED (2025-12-03) - Generate Visual Regression Test Baselines:**
  - Visual regression tests in `visual-regression.e2e.spec.ts` now have baseline snapshots
  - Run locally with `--update-snapshots` flag to generate baselines
  - Snapshots committed to repository for CI comparison
- **✅ COMPLETED - UX/UI Test Plan Execution:**
