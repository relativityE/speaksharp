# SpeakSharp

SpeakSharp is a privacy-first, real-time speech analysis tool designed to help users improve their public speaking skills. It provides instant, on-device feedback and is built as a modern, serverless SaaS web application using React (Vite) and Supabase.

## ðŸ“š Documentation

All project documentation is located in the `/docs` directory. For a complete overview and map of the documentation, please see **[./OUTLINE.md](./OUTLINE.md)**.

Here are the direct links to the core documents:

*   **[PRD.md](./PRD.md)**: The "What & Why" - Product Requirements Document.
*   **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**: The "How" - System Architecture and technical deep dive.
*   **[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)**: The "When & Status" - Development plan and project status.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
*   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
*   [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli)

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd speaksharp
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Populate the `.env` file with your Supabase project URL and anon key, as well as any other required service keys.

4.  **Set up the local database:**
    To reset your local Supabase database and populate it with required test users (e.g., free, premium), run the following command:
    ```bash
    pnpm db:seed
    ```
    This command completely resets the database, runs all migrations, and then executes the seed script.

### Development Workflow

Our goal is to make local development as smooth as possible. Here are some key scripts and variables to help you.

*   **Testing Premium Features Locally:**
    To test premium features without a real Stripe subscription, you can grant any user 'premium' status on the client-side. Add the following line to your `.env` file:
    ```
    VITE_DEV_PREMIUM_ACCESS=true
    ```
    When this variable is set, any user you are logged in as will have their subscription status overridden to `premium` in the app.

*   **Managing On-Device ML Models:**
    The on-device transcription feature requires ML model files to be hosted locally in the `/public/models` directory. To download or update a model from Hugging Face, use the `model:update` script:
    ```bash
    pnpm model:update Xenova/whisper-tiny.en
    ```
    Replace `Xenova/whisper-tiny.en` with the desired model name.

### Running the Development Server

To start the Vite development server, run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Troubleshooting
*   **`rounded-pill` error on startup:** This is often a caching issue with Vite. Try deleting the `node_modules/.vite` directory and restarting the dev server.
*   **API Key errors (401 Unauthorized):** Ensure your `.env` file is correctly populated with the `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and any other required keys. Refer to `.env.example` for the full list.
*   **`toast` notifications not appearing:** This is a known issue in local development. Please see the full list of [Known Issues in the PRD](./PRD.md#3-known-issues) for status.

## âœ… Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit and integration tests and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end tests.

*   **Run all tests:**
    ```bash
    pnpm test
    ```

*   **Run tests with UI:**
    ```bash
    pnpm test:ui
    ```

*   **Run E2E tests:**
    ```bash
    pnpm test:e2e
    ```

*   **E2E Test Setup (First-Time or New Environment):**
    The E2E tests require Playwright's browser binaries to be installed. If you are running in a new environment or encounter errors about missing executables, you may need to install them manually:
    ```bash
    pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps
    ```
    This command only needs to be run once.

## Linting

To check the code for linting errors, run:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

## Project Governance

### PM Perspective (Process & Documentation)

**Doing Well:**

*   Comprehensive [PRD.md](./PRD.md) and [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).
*   Phased milestones + MoSCoW prioritization in [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).

**Gaps / Fixes:**

*   Documentation was scattered; now consolidated into `/docs`.
*   Outdated root `README.md` replaced with accurate project overview.

**Strategic Guidance:**

*   Enforce **documentation governance**: each doc has a single purpose, reviewed quarterly.
*   For scaling: consider migrating to GitBook/Docusaurus once team >10 contributors.

### Cross-Reference Map

*   **PRD.md** â†’ What & Why (vision, roles, financials)
*   **ARCHITECTURE.md** â†’ How (system design, block diagrams)
*   **ROADMAP.md** â†’ When & Status (tasks, milestones, gating checks)
*   **REVIEW.md** â†’ Who & So What (leadership insight & direction)
