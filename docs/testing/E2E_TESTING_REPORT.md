## Test Suite Status

| Test File                 | Status  | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tests/anon.e2e.spec.ts`  | Passed  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `tests/auth.e2e.spec.ts`  | Passed  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `tests/free.e2e.spec.ts`  | **Failed**  | The test was failing due to a bug in the application logic in `src/pages/SessionPage.jsx` that prevented the upgrade dialog from appearing. A fix has been implemented, but verification is blocked by persistent test environment issues (port conflicts). |
| `tests/pro.e2e.spec.ts`   | Not Run | Blocked by the same test environment issues.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `tests/basic.e2e.spec.ts` | Not Run |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Discovered Bugs and Fixes

The following bugs were discovered and fixed during this debugging session:

1.  **Husky Pre-commit Hook:**
    *   **Issue:** The pre-commit hook was running on every file operation, not just on `git commit`.
    *   **Fix:** The `.husky/pre-commit` script was updated to only run during a real git commit.
2.  **TypeScript Errors:**
    *   **Issue:** Several TypeScript errors were preventing the application from compiling.
    *   **Fix:**
        *   Added `allowJs: true` to `tsconfig.json` to allow importing JavaScript modules.
        *   Added type definitions for `AuthChangeEvent` in `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`.
3.  **Upgrade Prompt Logic:**
    *   **Issue:** Two bugs in `src/pages/SessionPage.jsx` were preventing the "Upgrade to Pro" dialog from appearing for free users.
        1.  The `useSessionManager` hook was being destructured incorrectly.
        2.  The `saveAndBroadcastSession` function was not correctly handling the `usageExceeded` flag from the backend.
    *   **Fix:**
        1.  The `usageLimitExceeded` state is now managed locally in `SessionPage.jsx`.
        2.  The `saveAndBroadcastSession` function now correctly destructures the return value from `saveSessionToBackend` and updates the `usageLimitExceeded` state.
4.  **Upgrade Prompt Content:**
    *   **Issue:** The title and description in `UpgradePromptDialog.jsx` did not match the E2E test's expectations.
    *   **Fix:** The content of the dialog has been updated to match the test.

## Test Environment Issues

The following issues with the test environment were encountered:

1.  **Port Conflict:** The test server is not being reliably terminated after test runs, leading to "Port in use" errors. I attempted to fix this by modifying `playwright.config.ts` to set `reuseExistingServer: false`, but the issue persists.
2.  **Tool Unreliability:** The `read_file` and `run_in_bash_session` tools are not behaving as expected, which has made debugging very difficult.

## Missing `premium.e2e.spec.ts` Test

As requested, a new E2E test for the premium user flow needs to be created. This test should verify that premium users have access to all pro features, as well as on-device transcription and detailed analytics.

## Recommendations

1.  **Stabilize the test environment.** The "port in use" error needs to be resolved. The unreliability of the tools also needs to be addressed.
2.  **Verify the fixes for `free.e2e.spec.ts`.** Once the environment is stable, the `free.e2e.spec.ts` test should be run to confirm that the fixes have solved the problem.
3.  **Run all E2E tests.** The entire E2E test suite should be run to check for regressions.
4.  **Create the `premium.e2e.spec.ts` test.**
