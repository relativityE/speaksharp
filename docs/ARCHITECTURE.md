    *   **E2E:** Playwright
    *   **API Mocking:** Mock Service Worker (MSW)
    *   **Image Processing (Test):** node-canvas (replaces Jimp/Sharp for stability)

## Testing and CI/CD

SpeakSharp employs a robust, automated testing strategy designed around the principles of **"Trust but Verify"** and **"Single Source of Truth."** The entire framework is orchestrated to ensure that the local development experience perfectly mirrors the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.

### The Local Audit Script: The Canonical Entry Point

The `./test-audit.sh` script, located in the repository root, is the cornerstone of our quality assurance process. It is the **single, canonical entry point** for all code validation, used by both developers and the CI/CD pipeline.

*   **Purpose:** To provide a reliable, reproducible, and comprehensive audit of the codebase. If the local audit passes, the CI pipeline is expected to pass as well.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Environment Cleaning:** Cleans the workspace by removing stale build artifacts and TypeScript caches (`tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`) to prevent phantom errors.
    2.  **Static Analysis:** Runs linting (`pnpm eslint`) and type checking (`pnpm tsc --noEmit`).
    3.  **E2E Test Baseline:** Measures the runtime of each individual E2E test with a 4-minute timeout and saves the results to `docs/e2e-test-runtimes.json`.
    4.  **Dynamic Sharding:** Executes the `test-support/utils/create-shards.js` script to dynamically group tests into shards. Each shard's cumulative runtime is kept under 7 minutes to avoid platform timeouts in CI.
    5.  **Sharded Test Execution:** Runs each test shard sequentially.
    6.  **Reporting:** Generates a comprehensive markdown report at `test-support/test-audit-status.md`, summarizing the results of all steps.

### The `test-support/` Directory

All testing-related scripts, utilities, and generated reports are centralized in the `test-support/` directory to keep the root of the repository clean.

*   `utils/create-shards.js`: The dynamic sharding utility.
*   `shards/shard-manifest.json`: The generated shard plan (regenerated on each run).
*   `test-audit-status.md`: The final markdown report, serving as the Single Source of Truth for the latest audit run.

### CI/CD Pipeline

The project's CI pipeline, defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, is now a direct consumer of the `test-audit.sh` script. This ensures perfect alignment between local and remote validation. The pipeline simply checks out the code, installs dependencies, and runs `./test-audit.sh`.

### E2E Test Environment

The E2E test environment is designed to be isolated and reliable, ensuring that tests run consistently both locally and in CI.

1.  **Environment Separation:**
    *   The standard `pnpm dev` command runs the Vite server in **development mode**. This is for manual development and does not include any test-specific mocks or logic.
    *   The E2E tests (`pnpm test:e2e`) run against a Vite server that is launched with the `VITE_TEST_MODE=true` environment variable.
2.  **Conditional Mocking:**
    *   When `VITE_TEST_MODE` is true, the application's entry point (`src/main.tsx`) conditionally imports `/tests/e2e/testEnv.ts`.
    *   This `testEnv.ts` script is responsible for initializing the Mock Service Worker (MSW) and setting up the `window.mswReady` promise.
    *   This approach ensures that test-specific code is completely isolated and never included in a production build.
3.  **Automated Server Management:**
    *   Playwright's `webServer` configuration in `playwright.config.ts` automatically starts the test server (`pnpm dev`) with the necessary `VITE_TEST_MODE` flag.
    *   It waits for the server to be ready and automatically terminates it after the test run, simplifying the testing workflow.

### Mocking Native Dependencies

Some features, like the on-device transcription powered by `LocalWhisper`, rely on libraries with native dependencies (e.g., `sharp` for image processing, `@xenova/transformers` for ML models). These native dependencies can be difficult to install and build in certain environments, especially in CI/CD pipelines or sandboxed test runners.

To solve this, we use a mocking strategy for the test environment:

1.  **Optional Dependency:** The native dependency (`sharp`) is listed as an `optionalDependency` in `package.json`. This prevents the package manager from failing the installation if the native build step fails.
2.  **Vitest Alias:** In `vitest.config.mjs`, we create aliases that redirect imports of `sharp` and `@xenova/transformers` to mock files.
3.  **Canvas-based Mock:** To improve stability, the mock for `sharp` (`src/test/mocks/sharp.ts`) now uses the `canvas` library, a pure JavaScript image processing tool with better stability in headless environments. The mock for `@xenova/transformers` provides a simplified, lightweight implementation for unit tests.
4.  **Dependency Inlining:** Because the `@xenova/transformers` import happens within a dependency, we must configure Vitest to process this dependency by adding it to `test.deps.inline`. This ensures the alias is applied correctly.

This approach allows us to use the high-performance native library in production while maintaining a stable and easy-to-manage test environment.

## 3. Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with React and Vite.

*   **Component Model:** The UI is built from a combination of page-level components (`src/pages`), feature-specific components (`src/components/session`, `src/components/landing`), and a reusable UI library (`src/components/ui`).
*   **Design System:** The UI components in `src/components/ui` are built using `class-variance-authority` (CVA) for a flexible, type-safe, and maintainable design system. Design tokens are managed in `tailwind.config.ts`.
*   **State Management:** Global state is managed via a combination of React Context and custom hooks.
    *   **`AuthContext`:** The primary source for authentication state. It provides the Supabase `session` object, the `user` object, and the user's `profile` data.
    *   **`SessionContext`:** Manages the collection of a user's practice sessions (`sessionHistory`).
    *   **`useSessionManager`:** A custom hook that encapsulates the logic for saving, deleting, and exporting sessions.
    *   **`useAnalytics`:** A custom hook that fetches and processes analytics data from the Supabase database.
*   **Routing:** Client-side routing is handled by `react-router-dom`, with protected routes implemented to secure sensitive user pages.
*   **Logging:** The application uses `pino` for structured logging.
*   **PDF Generation:** Session reports can be exported as PDF documents using the `jspdf` and `jspdf-autotable` libraries. The `pdfGenerator.ts` utility encapsulates the logic for creating these reports.
*   **Analytics Components:** The frontend includes several components for displaying analytics, such as `FillerWordTable`, `FillerWordTrend`, `SessionComparison`, `TopFillerWords`, and `AccuracyComparison`.
*   **AI-Powered Suggestions:** The `AISuggestions` component provides users with feedback on their speech.
*   **Image Processing:** The application uses `canvas` in the test environment for image processing tasks (replacing `Jimp` for stability), such as resizing user-uploaded images. The `processImage.ts` utility provides a convenient wrapper for this functionality.

### 3.1. Key Components

- **`SessionSidebar.tsx`**: This component serves as the main control panel for a user's practice session. It contains the start/stop controls, a digital timer, and the transcription mode selector.
  - **Mode Selector**: A segmented button group allows users to choose their desired transcription mode before starting a session. The options are:
    - **Cloud AI**: Utilizes the high-accuracy AssemblyAI cloud service.
    - **On-Device**: Uses a local Whisper model for privacy-focused transcription.
    - **Native**: Falls back to the browser's built-in speech recognition engine.
  - **Access Control**: Access to the "Cloud AI" and "On-Device" modes is restricted. These modes are enabled for users with a "pro" subscription status or for developers when the `VITE_DEV_USER` environment variable is set to `true`. Free users are restricted to the "Native" mode.

### Homepage Routing Logic
The application's homepage (`/`) has special routing logic to handle different user states. This logic is located directly within the `HomePage.tsx` component.
- **Production (`import.meta.env.DEV` is false):** Authenticated users who navigate to the homepage are automatically redirected to the main application interface (`/session`). This ensures they land on a functional page after logging in.
- **Development (`import.meta.env.DEV` is true):** The redirect is disabled. This allows developers to access and work on the public-facing homepage components even while being authenticated.

### Memory Leak Prevention
Given the real-time nature of the application, proactive memory management is critical. Components involving continuous data streams (e.g., `useSpeechRecognition`, `TranscriptionService`) must be carefully audited for memory leaks. This includes ensuring all `useEffect` hooks have proper cleanup functions.

## 4. Backend Architecture

The backend is built entirely on the Supabase platform, leveraging its integrated services.

*   **Database:** A PostgreSQL database managed by Supabase. Schema is managed via migration files in `supabase/migrations`.
*   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth is used for user registration, login, and session management.
*   **Serverless Functions:** Deno-based Edge Functions are used for secure, server-side logic.
    *   `assemblyai-token`: Securely generates temporary tokens for the AssemblyAI transcription service.
    *   `stripe-checkout`: Handles the creation of Stripe checkout sessions.
    *   `stripe-webhook`: Listens for and processes webhooks from Stripe to update user subscription status.

## 5. User Roles and Tiers

The application's user tiers have been consolidated into the following structure:

*   **Free User (Authenticated):** A user who has created an account but does not have an active Pro subscription. This is the entry-level tier for all users.
*   **Pro User (Authenticated):** A user with an active, paid subscription via Stripe. This tier includes all features, such as unlimited practice time, cloud-based AI transcription, and privacy-preserving on-device transcription.

## 6. Transcription Service (`src/services/transcription`)

The `TranscriptionService.ts` provides a unified abstraction layer over multiple transcription providers.

*   **Modes:**
    *   **`CloudAssemblyAI`:** Uses the AssemblyAI v3 streaming API for high-accuracy cloud-based transcription. This is one of the modes available to Pro users.
    *   **`NativeBrowser`:** Uses the browser's built-in `SpeechRecognition` API. This is the primary mode for Free users and a fallback for Pro users.
    *   **`LocalWhisper`:** An on-device, privacy-first transcription mode for Pro users, powered by `@xenova/transformers` running a Whisper model directly in the browser.
*   **Audio Processing:** `audioUtils.ts`, `audioUtils.impl.ts`, and `audio-processor.worklet.js` are responsible for capturing and resampling microphone input. A critical bug in the resampling logic that was degrading AI quality has been fixed.

### On-Device STT Implementation Details

The `LocalWhisper` provider uses the [`@xenova/transformers.js`](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js) library to run the `Xenova/whisper-tiny.en` model directly in the user's browser.

*   **How it Works (Hybrid Model Loading):**
    1.  **Primary Source (Hugging Face Hub):** The application first attempts to download the `Xenova/whisper-tiny.en` model directly from the Hugging Face Hub. This ensures users get the latest compatible version of the model without requiring an application update.
    2.  **Fallback Source (Local):** If the download from the Hub fails (due to network issues, a service outage, or restrictive firewalls), the system automatically falls back to loading a known-good version of the model hosted locally within the application at `/public/models/`. This hybrid approach maximizes availability and resilience.
    3.  **Caching:** Once loaded from either source, the model is cached in the browser's `CacheStorage`, making subsequent loads nearly instant.
    4.  **Inference Engine:** The library runs the model on a WebAssembly (WASM) version of the ONNX Runtime. This allows for near-native performance for model inference directly in the browser.
    5.  **Privacy:** All audio processing and transcription occurs entirely on the user's machine. No audio data is ever sent to a third-party server.

*   **Comparison to Cloud AI:**
    *   **Privacy:** On-device is 100% private. Cloud AI requires sending audio data to AssemblyAI's servers.
    *   **Accuracy:** Cloud AI is significantly more accurate as it uses a much larger model (`whisper-large-v3` equivalent). The on-device `whisper-tiny.en` model is less accurate but still highly effective for its size.
    *   **Performance:** On-device has a one-time initial download cost. After caching, it is very fast. Cloud AI has a constant network latency for streaming audio and receiving transcripts.
    *   **Cost:** On-device has no per-use cost. Cloud AI has a direct cost per minute of transcribed audio.
    *   **Availability:** On-device mode is highly available. It works offline after the initial model download (from either the Hub or the local fallback). A failure of the Hugging Face Hub will not prevent the feature from working, as the local fallback will be used.

### Speaker Identification

Speaker identification (or diarization) is handled by the AssemblyAI API. When the `speaker_labels` parameter is set to `true` in the transcription request, the API will return a `speaker` property for each utterance in the transcript. This allows the frontend to display who said what.

### STT Accuracy Comparison

The STT accuracy comparison feature calculates the Word Error Rate (WER) of each transcription engine against a "ground truth" transcript. The ground truth is a manually transcribed version of the audio that is stored in the `practice_sessions` table. The WER is then used to calculate an accuracy percentage, which is displayed in the analytics dashboard. This provides users with a clear understanding of how each STT engine performs.

## 7. Known Issues

*   **E2E Test Environment Instability:** The E2E test suite was suffering from persistent timeouts. The root causes were identified as a combination of:
    1.  An unreliable `AuthProvider` loading state that would prevent the application from rendering in the test environment.
    2.  A fragile custom test wrapper (`verifyOnlyStepTracker.ts`) that could hang indefinitely.
    3.  A polluted test environment with zombie processes and stale browser sessions.
    *   **Resolution:** The `AuthProvider` has been fixed to initialize its loading state correctly in test mode. The test wrapper has been replaced with a resilient version that includes timeouts. The test suite has been updated to ensure a clean state (`localStorage` clearing) before runs.

## 8. Technical Debt

*   **Custom Test Wrapper (`verifyOnlyStepTracker.ts`):** The custom test wrapper, while useful for debugging, adds a layer of complexity and was a contributing factor to test hangs. It has been replaced with a more resilient version, but for critical smoke tests, it is recommended to use the `plainTest` and `plainExpect` exports from this file to bypass the wrappers entirely, ensuring maximum stability.
*   **Redundant Mocking Systems:** The codebase previously contained two conflicting mocking systems (MSW and Playwright's `page.route`). This has been resolved by consolidating all API mocking into MSW, but the pattern should be monitored to prevent re-introduction.
