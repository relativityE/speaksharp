## Testing and CI/CD

SpeakSharp employs a unified and resilient testing strategy designed for speed and reliability. The entire process is orchestrated by a single script, `test-audit.sh`, which ensures that the local development experience perfectly mirrors the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.

### The Canonical Audit Script (`test-audit.sh`)

This script is the **single source of truth** for all code validation. It is accessed via simple `pnpm` commands (e.g., `pnpm audit`) and is optimized for a 7-minute CI timeout by using aggressive parallelization.

*   **Stage 1: Parallel Quality Checks:** Runs linting, type checking, and unit tests concurrently to maximize speed.
*   **Stage 2: Build:** Compiles the application using a production-like test configuration.
*   **Stage 3: Parallel E2E Tests:** Runs the entire E2E suite in parallel shards to ensure completion well under the CI timeout.

### CI/CD Pipeline

The CI pipeline, defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, is a simple, single-job process that runs the canonical audit script. This ensures perfect consistency between local and CI environments.

### Application Environments (Production, Development, and Test)

Understanding the environment separation is crucial for both development and testing. Based on my analysis of the project's configuration and documentation, here is a breakdown of the three key environments and how the dev server relates to them.

The Three Core Environments
Think of the environments as three different contexts in which the application runs, each with its own purpose, configuration, and data.

1. Production Environment (production)
Purpose: This is the live, public-facing version of your application that real users interact with. It's optimized for performance, stability, and security.
Key Characteristics:
Optimized Code: The code is minified, bundled, and tree-shaken to be as small and fast as possible.
Real Data: It connects to the production Supabase database and live third-party services like Stripe and AssemblyAI using production API keys.
Security: Debugging features are disabled, and security is paramount.
How it's Launched: The production environment isn't "launched" with a dev server. Instead, a static build of the frontend is created using pnpm build. This build is then deployed to and served by a hosting provider (like Vercel or Netlify). The backend is the live Supabase instance.
2. Local Development Environment (development)
Purpose: This is your primary day-to-day workspace for building and debugging new features on your own machine.
Key Characteristics:
Hot Module Replacement (HMR): Code changes appear instantly in the browser without a full page reload, maximizing developer productivity.
Developer-Friendly Tooling: Includes source maps for easier debugging and verbose error messages in the console.
Flexible Data: It typically connects to a development or local Supabase instance, but can be configured (via .env.local files) to connect to production if needed (though this is generally discouraged). Developer-specific flags like VITE_DEV_USER can be enabled here.
How it's Launched: This environment is launched using the pnpm dev command. This command runs vite, which starts the Vite development server. By default, Vite runs in development mode, which enables all the features mentioned above.
3. Test Environment (test)
Purpose: This is a specialized, automated environment designed exclusively for running tests (especially End-to-End tests with Playwright). Its goal is to create a consistent, isolated, and controllable simulation of the application.
Key Characteristics:
Mocked Backend: It does not connect to a real Supabase database. Instead, it uses Mock Service Worker (MSW) to intercept all API calls and provide predictable, fake data. This ensures tests are fast and reliable.
Compile-Time Modifications: This is the most critical distinction. When the server is launched in test mode, a special build-time flag, import.meta.env.VITE_TEST_MODE, is set to true. The application's source code uses this flag to conditionally exclude certain libraries (like the onnxruntime-web for on-device transcription) that are known to crash the Playwright test runner.
Headless Operation: This environment is designed to be run by an automated tool (Playwright), not a human.
How it's Launched: The test environment's dev server is not launched by you directly with pnpm dev. Instead, it is launched automatically by the test runner (Playwright) when you run a command like pnpm test:e2e. The Playwright configuration file (playwright.config.ts) is configured to start the Vite server using a specific command: vite --mode test. This --mode test flag is what tells Vite to apply the special test configuration.
Summary: How the Dev Server Relates to Environments
Environment	How Dev Server is Started	Vite Mode	Key Feature
Production	Not applicable (uses a static build from pnpm build)	production	Optimized for users
Local	Manually, with pnpm dev	development	Optimized for developers (HMR)
Test	Automatically, by Playwright during tests	test	Optimized for automation (Mocking, Code Exclusion)
In short, the command you use to launch the dev server (pnpm dev vs. the test runner's internal command) is what determines which environment-specific configuration is applied, resulting in three very different application behaviors tailored to the task at hand.


You should NOT have to pass .env.test on the command line.

The system is designed to handle this automatically, and forcing it with a command like dotenv -e .env.test is a symptom that the underlying configuration is wrong (which it was, and which we have now fixed).

Here is the correct, intended workflow based on the project's architecture with Vite:

For Local Development (your workflow):

You run pnpm dev.
This starts vite in its default development mode.
Vite automatically looks for and loads environment variables from .env.development.local, .env.development, and falls back to .env.local. Your use of .env.local is perfectly standard here.
For the Test Environment (the automated workflow):

The E2E tests are run (e.g., via ./test-audit.sh).
The test runner, Playwright, is configured in playwright.config.ts to launch the web server.
Crucially, that configuration tells Playwright to use the command vite --mode test.
This --mode test flag is the key. It instructs Vite to automatically look for and load environment variables ONLY from .env.test (and .env.test.local).
So, the framework itself ensures the correct .env file is used based on the mode it's running in. The fix I implemented to the package.json was essential to restore this intended behavior, ensuring pnpm dev uses development mode and leaves the test mode to be used exclusively by the testing framework.

### Decoupled Health-Check and Visual State Capture

Our E2E testing strategy separates the concern of functional validation from visual documentation. This is achieved through two distinct, specialized tests:

*   **`tests/e2e/health-check.e2e.spec.ts` (Functional Validation):** This is the primary health check for the application. It is a lean, focused test that performs one critical task: it verifies that a user can successfully authenticate using the `programmaticLogin` helper. Its purpose is to provide a fast, reliable signal that the core authentication flow is working. It makes no assertions about the visual state of the UI beyond what is necessary to confirm a successful login.

*   **`tests/e2e/capture-states.e2e.spec.ts` (Visual Documentation):** This test is not for functional validation but is a dedicated tool for generating visual artifacts. It uses the `programmaticLogin` helper to get the application into various states (e.g., authenticated, unauthenticated) and captures screenshots of the UI.

This decoupled architecture is a key to a stable test suite. It ensures that a purely visual change to the UI (e.g., a CSS refactor) will not break the critical, functional health check.

### Unit & Integration Testing for React Query

Testing components that use React Query requires a specific setup to ensure tests are isolated and deterministic. Our project uses a combination of two key utilities to achieve this.

*   **`createQueryWrapper` (`tests/test-utils/queryWrapper.tsx`):** This is a higher-order function that provides a fresh, isolated `QueryClient` for each test. This is the most critical piece of the puzzle, as it prevents the React Query cache from bleeding between tests, which would otherwise lead to unpredictable and flaky results. It is used to wrap the component under test in React Testing Library's `render` function.

*   **`makeQuerySuccess` (`tests/test-utils/queryMocks.ts`):** This is a factory function that creates a standardized, successful mock result object for a React Query hook. When testing a component that uses a custom hook like `usePracticeHistory`, this utility makes it easy to create a properly typed success object (`status: 'success'`, `isLoading: false`, etc.) to provide as the mock return value.

Together, these utilities form the canonical pattern for testing any component that relies on React Query, ensuring that our unit and integration tests are fast, reliable, and easy to maintain.

### E2E Test Environment & Core Patterns

The E2E test environment is designed for stability and isolation. Several key architectural patterns have been implemented to address sources of test flakiness and instability.

1.  **Build-Time Conditional for Incompatible Libraries:**
    *   **Problem:** Certain libraries, like `onnxruntime-web` (used for on-device transcription), are fundamentally incompatible with the Playwright/Node.js test environment and cause untraceable browser crashes.
    *   **Architecture:** The build process now uses a dedicated Vite build mode (`--mode test`). This sets a build-time variable, `import.meta.env.VITE_TEST_MODE`. The application's source code uses this variable to create a compile-time conditional (`if (import.meta.env.VITE_TEST_MODE)`) that completely removes the problematic `import()` statements from the test build. This is a robust solution that prevents the incompatible code from ever being loaded.

2.  **Explicit E2E Hooks for Authentication:**
    *   **Problem:** Programmatically injecting a session into the Supabase client from a test script does not automatically trigger the necessary state updates within the application's React `AuthProvider` context.
    *   **Architecture:** A custom event system was created to bridge this gap. The `programmaticLogin` test helper dispatches a custom browser event (`__E2E_SESSION_INJECTED__`) after setting the session. The `AuthProvider` now contains a `useEffect` hook that listens for this specific event and manually updates its internal state, forcing a UI re-render. This ensures the application reliably reflects the authenticated state during tests.

3.  **Supabase Client Test Exposure:**
    *   **Problem:** E2E tests need a reference to the application's internal Supabase client to perform programmatic login.
    *   **Architecture:** The `supabaseClient.ts` module now attaches the client instance to the `window` object (`window.supabase`) when the application is not in a production environment. This provides a stable and predictable way for test helpers to access and interact with the client.

7.  **Deterministic Test Handshake for Authentication:**
    *   **Problem:** The core of the E2E test suite's instability was a race condition between the test runner injecting an authentication session and the React application's `AuthProvider` recognizing and rendering the UI for that state.
    *   **Architecture:** A deterministic, event-driven handshake was implemented to eliminate this race condition. This is the canonical pattern for ensuring the application is fully authenticated and rendered before any test assertions are made.

    ```ascii
    +---------------------------------+
    |        Playwright Test          |
    |  (e.g., health-check.spec.ts)   |

    (5) Receives 'SIGNED_IN' event from mock client.
    (6) Fetches user profile from mock client.

    |      (Still in control)         |
    +--------------- | ---------------+
                    |
    (8) Is waiting for the 'e2e-profile-loaded' event.
    (9) After event, waits for a stable UI element
        (e.g., [data-testid="nav-sign-out-button"])
        to become visible.
                    |
    (10) Returns control to the test.
                    |
    +--------------- V ---------------+
    |        Playwright Test          |
    |         (Resumes)               |
    +---------------------------------+
    ```
    *   **Key Insight:** This architecture is deterministic and eliminates race conditions. The test does not proceed until it receives a definitive signal (`e2e-profile-loaded`) directly from the application, confirming that the `AuthProvider` has fully initialized, the user profile has been fetched, and the UI is ready. This creates a stable and reliable foundation for all authenticated E2E tests.

1.  **Sequential MSW Initialization:**
    *   **Problem:** E2E tests would fail with race conditions because the React application could mount and trigger network requests *before* the Mock Service Worker (MSW) was ready to intercept them.
    *   **Solution:** The application's bootstrap logic in `src/main.tsx` has been made sequential for the test environment. It now strictly `await`s the asynchronous `msw.worker.start()` promise to complete **before** it calls `renderApp()`. This guarantees that the entire mock API layer is active before any React component mounts, eliminating the race condition. A `window.mswReady = true` flag is set after MSW is ready to signal this state to tests.

2.  **Programmatic Login for Authentication (E2E):**
    *   **Problem:** E2E tests require a fast, stable way to authenticate. The login process was flaky due to a race condition between the `AuthProvider`'s asynchronous state updates and the test's assertions against the DOM.
    *   **Solution:** The `programmaticLogin` helper has been hardened. After injecting the mock session, it no longer waits for an unreliable internal flag (`window.__E2E_PROFILE_LOADED__`). Instead, it directly waits for the user-visible result of a successful login: the appearance of the "Sign Out" button in the navigation bar. This ensures the test only proceeds after React's render cycle is fully complete and the DOM is in a consistent, authenticated state.

3.  **Third-Party Service Stubbing:**
    *   To prevent external services like Sentry and PostHog from causing noise or failures in E2E tests, the `stubThirdParties(page)` helper is used. It intercepts and aborts any requests to these services' domains, ensuring tests are isolated and deterministic.

4.  **Standardized Page Object Model (POM):**
    *   **Problem:** The E2E test suite had an inconsistent and duplicated structure for Page Object Models, leading to confusion and maintenance overhead.
    *   **Solution:** The POMs have been centralized into a single, canonical location: `tests/pom/`.
    *   **Barrel Exports:** A barrel file (`tests/pom/index.ts`) is used to export all POMs from this central location. This provides a single, clean import path for all test files (e.g., `import { SessionPage } from '../pom';`), which improves maintainability and prevents module resolution issues in the test runner.

5.  **Source-Code-Level Guard for Incompatible Libraries:**
    *   **Problem:** The on-device transcription feature uses the `onnxruntime-web` library, which relies on WebAssembly. This library is fundamentally incompatible with the Playwright test environment and causes a silent, catastrophic browser crash that is untraceable with standard debugging tools.
    *   **Solution:** A test-aware guard has been implemented directly in the application's source code.
        *   **Flag Injection:** The `programmaticLogin` helper in `tests/e2e/helpers.ts` uses `page.addInitScript()` to inject a global `window.TEST_MODE = true;` flag before any application code runs.
        *   **Conditional Import:** The `TranscriptionService.ts` checks for the presence of `window.TEST_MODE`. If the flag is true, it completely skips the dynamic import of the `LocalWhisper` module that would have loaded the crashing library. Instead, it gracefully falls back to the safe, native browser transcription engine.
    *   **Benefit:** This source-code-level solution is more robust than network-level blocking (`page.route`), which can be unreliable with modern bundlers. It directly prevents the incompatible code from ever being loaded in the test environment.

6.  **Stateful Mocking with `localStorage`:**
    *   **Problem:** The Playwright `addInitScript` function re-runs on every page navigation (`page.goto()`). If a mock client stores its state (e.g., the current user session) in a simple variable, that state is wiped on every navigation, causing tests to fail.
    *   **Architecture:** The mock Supabase client has been architected to be stateful by using `localStorage`. On initialization, it reads the session from `localStorage`. When the test performs a programmatic login, the mock writes the session to `localStorage`. This accurately simulates the behavior of the real Supabase client, ensuring that the authenticated state persists reliably across page navigations within a test.

These patterns work together to create a robust testing foundation, eliminating the primary sources of flakiness and making the E2E suite a reliable indicator of application quality.

### Visual State Capture for Documentation

To aid in documentation and provide a quick visual reference of the application's key states, a dedicated E2E test file is used for capturing screenshots.

-   **File:** `tests/e2e/capture-states.e2e.spec.ts`
-   **Purpose:** This test is not for functional verification but for generating consistent, high-quality screenshots of the application's primary UI states (e.g., unauthenticated homepage, authenticated homepage, analytics page).
-   **Output:** The screenshots are saved to the `/screenshots` directory in the project root, which is explicitly ignored by `.gitignore`.
-   **Usage:** To regenerate the screenshots, run the test directly:
    ```bash
    pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/capture-states.e2e.spec.ts
    ```
This provides a simple, repeatable process for updating visual documentation as the application evolves.

### Known Architectural Limitations

- **`audio-processor.worklet.js` Migration:** This file is intentionally left as JavaScript and excluded from the TypeScript migration. It is a Web Audio Worklet, a specialized script that runs in a high-performance audio thread. Migrating it to TypeScript is a high-risk task that requires a custom build process and deep expertise in the Web Audio API. A failed migration would not cause a crash but could silently corrupt audio data, dramatically reducing AI transcription accuracy. The risk of silently breaking the application's core feature outweighs the benefit of type safety for this isolated file.

### E2E Test Architecture: Fixtures and Programmatic Login

To ensure E2E tests are fast, reliable, and deterministic, the test suite uses a sophisticated fixture-based architecture for handling authentication and mock data.

*   **Separation of Concerns:** The test helpers follow a strict separation of concerns:
    *   `tests/e2e/fixtures/mockData.ts`: This file is the single source of truth for all mock data (users, profiles, sessions, etc.). It exports typed constants, making data management clean and maintainable.
    *   `tests/e2e/helpers.ts`: This file contains the logic for test setup, primarily the `programmaticLogin` function. It is responsible for injecting mocks and data into the browser context.

*   **`programmaticLogin` Workflow:** This is the canonical function for authenticating a user in an E2E test. It executes the following sequence:
    1.  **Inject Mock Supabase Client:** Before any application code runs, `page.addInitScript()` injects a complete mock of the Supabase client into the `window` object. This mock is pre-populated with the data imported from `mockData.ts`. This ensures the application boots up with a predictable and consistent data environment.
    2.  **Generate a Fake JWT:** The helper generates a structurally valid but cryptographically fake JWT. This is crucial because the application's frontend code may decode the JWT to read user claims (like `sub`, `email`, `role`). A simple string token would cause these decoding operations to fail. The fake JWT ensures the frontend behaves as it would with a real session.
    3.  **Atomic Session Injection and Event Handshake:** In a single `page.evaluate()` call, the helper performs two critical actions to prevent race conditions:
        *   It first sets up a `Promise` that listens for a custom `e2e-profile-loaded` DOM event.
        *   It then calls the mock Supabase client's `setSession` method, passing in the fake JWT.
    4.  **Application Response:** The application's `AuthProvider` receives the session, fetches the user's profile from the mock client, and, upon success, fires the `e2e-profile-loaded` event.
    5.  **Resolution:** The `Promise` in the test resolves, and `programmaticLogin` completes, now certain that the application is fully authenticated and rendered.

*   **Known Limitations - Mocking `TranscriptionService`:**
    *   **Problem:** The `TranscriptionService`, which manages real-time audio processing, has proven difficult to mock reliably at the E2E level. Both `page.evaluate` and `page.route` strategies have been unsuccessful, indicating a deep architectural coupling or a test environment limitation.
    *   **Current State:** The `live-transcript.e2e.spec.ts` test is therefore superficial and only verifies that the UI enters a "recording" state. This has been documented as technical debt in `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

### Mocking Native Dependencies

Some features, like the on-device transcription powered by `LocalWhisper`, rely on libraries with native dependencies (e.g., `sharp` for image processing, `@xenova/transformers` for ML models). These native dependencies can be difficult to install and build in certain environments, especially in CI/CD pipelines or sandboxed test runners.

To solve this, we use a mocking strategy for the test environment:

1.  **Optional Dependency:** The native dependency (`sharp`) is listed as an `optionalDependency` in `package.json`. This prevents the package manager from failing the installation if the native build step fails.
2.  **Vitest Alias:** In `vitest.config.mjs`, we create aliases that redirect imports of `sharp` and `@xenova/transformers` to mock files.
3.  **Canvas-based Mock:** To improve stability, the mock for `sharp` (`src/test/mocks/sharp.ts`) now uses the `canvas` library, a pure JavaScript image processing tool with better stability in headless environments. The mock for `@xenova/transformers` provides a simplified, lightweight implementation for unit tests.
4.  **Dependency Inlining:** Because the `@xenova/transformers` import happens within a dependency, we must configure Vitest to process this dependency by adding it to `test.deps.inline`. This ensures the alias is applied correctly.

This approach allows us to use the high-performance native library in production while maintaining a stable and easy-to-manage test environment.

## 3. Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with React and Vite.

*   **Component Model:** The UI is built from a combination of page-level components (`src/pages`), feature-specific components (`src/components/session`, `src/components/landing`), and a reusable UI library (`src/components/ui`).
*   **Design System:** The UI components in `src/components/ui` are built using `class-variance-authority` (CVA) for a flexible, type-safe, and maintainable design system. Design tokens are managed in `tailwind.config.ts`.
*   **State Management:** See Section 3.1 below.
*   **Routing:** Client-side routing is handled by `react-router-dom`, with protected routes implemented to secure sensitive user pages.
*   **Logging:** The application uses `pino` for structured logging.
*   **PDF Generation:** Session reports can be exported as PDF documents using the `jspdf` and `jspdf-autotable` libraries. The `pdfGenerator.ts` utility encapsulates the logic for creating these reports.
*   **Analytics Components:** The frontend includes several components for displaying analytics, such as `FillerWordTable`, `FillerWordTrend`, `SessionComparison`, `TopFillerWords`, and `AccuracyComparison`.
*   **AI-Powered Suggestions:** The `AISuggestions` component provides users with feedback on their speech.
*   **Image Processing:** The application uses `canvas` in the test environment for image processing tasks (replacing `Jimp` for stability), such as resizing user-uploaded images. The `processImage.ts` utility provides a convenient wrapper for this functionality.

### 3.1. State Management and Data Fetching

The application employs a hybrid state management strategy that clearly separates **global UI state** from **server state**.

*   **Global State (`AuthContext`):** The `AuthContext` is the single source of truth for global, cross-cutting concerns, primarily user identity and session state. It provides the Supabase `session` object and the `user` object to all components that need it. This is the only global context in the application. Profile data is explicitly decoupled and fetched via the `useUserProfile` hook.

*   **Server State & Data Fetching (`@tanstack/react-query`):** All application data that is fetched from the backend (e.g., a user's practice history) is managed by `@tanstack/react-query` (React Query). This library handles all the complexities of data fetching, caching, re-fetching, and error handling.
    *   **Decoupled Architecture:** This approach decouples data fetching from global state. Previously, the application used a second global context (`SessionContext`) to hold practice history, which was a brittle anti-pattern. The new architecture eliminates this, ensuring that components fetch the data they need, when they need it.
    *   **Custom Hooks:** The data-fetching logic is encapsulated in custom hooks, with `usePracticeHistory` being the canonical example. This hook fetches the user's session history and is conditionally enabled, only running when a user is authenticated.
    *   **Cache Invalidation:** When a user completes a new practice session, the application uses React Query's `queryClient.invalidateQueries` function to intelligently mark the `sessionHistory` data as stale. This automatically triggers a re-fetch, ensuring the UI is always up-to-date without manual state management.

This decoupled architecture is highly scalable and maintainable, as new data requirements can be met by creating new, isolated custom hooks without polluting the global state.

### 3.2. Key Components

- **`SessionSidebar.tsx`**: This component serves as the main control panel for a user's practice session. It contains the start/stop controls, a digital timer, and the transcription mode selector.
  - **Mode Selector**: A segmented button group allows users to choose their desired transcription mode before starting a session. The options are:
    - **Cloud AI**: Utilizes the high-accuracy AssemblyAI cloud service.
    - **On-Device**: Uses a local Whisper model for privacy-focused transcription.
    - **Native**: Falls back to the browser's built-in speech recognition engine.
  - **Access Control**: Access to the "Cloud AI" and "On-Device" modes is restricted. These modes are enabled for users with a "pro" subscription status or for developers when the `VITE_DEV_USER` environment variable is set to `true`. Free users are restricted to the "Native" mode.

### Homepage Routing Logic
The application's homepage (`/`) has special routing logic to handle different user states. This logic is located directly within the `HomePage.tsx` component.
- **Production (`import.meta.env.DEV` is false):** Authenticated users who navigate to the homepage are automatically redirected to the main application interface (`/session`). This ensures they land on a functional page after logging in.
- **Development (`import.meta.env.DEV` is true):** The redirect is disabled. This allows developers to access and work on the public-facing homepage components even while being authenticated.

### Memory Leak Prevention
Given the real-time nature of the application, proactive memory management is critical. Components involving continuous data streams (e.g., `useSpeechRecognition`, `TranscriptionService`) must be carefully audited for memory leaks. This includes ensuring all `useEffect` hooks have proper cleanup functions.

## 4. Backend Architecture

The backend is built entirely on the Supabase platform, leveraging its integrated services.

*   **Database:** A PostgreSQL database managed by Supabase. Schema is managed via migration files in `supabase/migrations`.
*   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth is used for user registration, login, and session management.
*   **Serverless Functions:** Deno-based Edge Functions are used for secure, server-side logic.
    *   `assemblyai-token`: Securely generates temporary tokens for the AssemblyAI transcription service.
    *   `stripe-checkout`: Handles the creation of Stripe checkout sessions.
    *   `stripe-webhook`: Listens for and processes webhooks from Stripe to update user subscription status.

## 5. User Roles and Tiers

The application's user tiers have been consolidated into the following structure:

*   **Free User (Authenticated):** A user who has created an account but does not have an active Pro subscription. This is the entry-level tier for all users.
*   **Pro User (Authenticated):** A user with an active, paid subscription via Stripe. This tier includes all features, such as unlimited practice time, cloud-based AI transcription, and privacy-preserving on-device transcription.

## 6. Transcription Service (`src/services/transcription`)

The `TranscriptionService.ts` provides a unified abstraction layer over multiple transcription providers.

*   **Modes:**
    *   **`CloudAssemblyAI`:** Uses the AssemblyAI v3 streaming API for high-accuracy cloud-based transcription. This is one of the modes available to Pro users.
    *   **`NativeBrowser`:** Uses the browser's built-in `SpeechRecognition` API. This is the primary mode for Free users and a fallback for Pro users.
    *   **`LocalWhisper`:** An on-device, privacy-first transcription mode for Pro users, powered by `@xenova/transformers` running a Whisper model directly in the browser.
*   **Audio Processing:** `audioUtils.ts`, `audioUtils.impl.ts`, and `audio-processor.worklet.js` are responsible for capturing and resampling microphone input. A critical bug in the resampling logic that was degrading AI quality has been fixed.

### On-Device STT Implementation Details

The `LocalWhisper` provider uses the [`@xenova/transformers.js`](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js) library to run the `Xenova/whisper-tiny.en` model directly in the user's browser.

*   **How it Works (Hybrid Model Loading):**
    1.  **Primary Source (Hugging Face Hub):** The application first attempts to download the `Xenova/whisper-tiny.en` model directly from the Hugging Face Hub. This ensures users get the latest compatible version of the model without requiring an application update.
    2.  **Fallback Source (Local):** If the download from the Hub fails (due to network issues, a service outage, or restrictive firewalls), the system automatically falls back to loading a known-good version of the model hosted locally within the application at `/public/models/`. This hybrid approach maximizes availability and resilience.
    3.  **Caching:** Once loaded from either source, the model is cached in the browser's `CacheStorage`, making subsequent loads nearly instant.
    4.  **Inference Engine:** The library runs the model on a WebAssembly (WASM) version of the ONNX Runtime. This allows for near-native performance for model inference directly in the browser.
    5.  **Privacy:** All audio processing and transcription occurs entirely on the user's machine. No audio data is ever sent to a third-party server.

*   **Comparison to Cloud AI:**
    *   **Privacy:** On-device is 100% private. Cloud AI requires sending audio data to AssemblyAI's servers.
    *   **Accuracy:** Cloud AI is significantly more accurate as it uses a much larger model (`whisper-large-v3` equivalent). The on-device `whisper-tiny.en` model is less accurate but still highly effective for its size.
    *   **Performance:** On-device has a one-time initial download cost. After caching, it is very fast. Cloud AI has a constant network latency for streaming audio and receiving transcripts.
    *   **Cost:** On-device has no per-use cost. Cloud AI has a direct cost per minute of transcribed audio.
    *   **Availability:** On-device mode is highly available. It works offline after the initial model download (from either the Hub or the local fallback). A failure of the Hugging Face Hub will not prevent the feature from working, as the local fallback will be used.

### Speaker Identification

Speaker identification (or diarization) is handled by the AssemblyAI API. When the `speaker_labels` parameter is set to `true` in the transcription request, the API will return a `speaker` property for each utterance in the transcript. This allows the frontend to display who said what.

### STT Accuracy Comparison

The STT accuracy comparison feature calculates the Word Error Rate (WER) of each transcription engine against a "ground truth" transcript. The ground truth is a manually transcribed version of the audio that is stored in the `practice_sessions` table. The WER is then used to calculate an accuracy percentage, which is displayed in the analytics dashboard. This provides users with a clear understanding of how each STT engine performs.
