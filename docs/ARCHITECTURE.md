## 2. Technology Stack

SpeakSharp is built on a modern, serverless technology stack designed for real-time applications.

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Framework:** React (v18) with Vite
    *   **Language:** TypeScript / JavaScript (JSX)
    *   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with a CVA-based design system
    *   **State Management:** React Context and custom hooks
*   **Backend (BaaS):**
    *   **Platform:** Supabase
    *   **Database:** Supabase Postgres
    *   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth
    *   **Serverless Functions:** Deno Edge Functions (for AssemblyAI token generation, Stripe integration, etc.)
*   **Third-Party Services:**
    *   **Cloud Transcription:** AssemblyAI (v3 Streaming API)
    *   **Payments:** Stripe
*   **Testing:**
    *   **Unit/Integration:** Vitest
    *   **E2E:** Playwright

## 2. Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with React and Vite.

*   **Component Model:** The UI is built from a combination of page-level components (`src/pages`), feature-specific components (`src/components/session`, `src/components/landing`), and a reusable UI library (`src/components/ui`). The analytics dashboard features a `FillerWordTable` component for displaying per-session filler word statistics for the 5 most recent sessions. This table includes color-coded severity indicators and tooltips with trend data.
*   **Design System:** The UI components in `src/components/ui` are built using `class-variance-authority` (CVA) for a flexible, type-safe, and maintainable design system. Design tokens are managed in `tailwind.config.ts`.
*   **State Management:** Global state is managed via a combination of React Context and custom hooks, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.
    *   **`AuthContext`:** This is the primary source for authentication state. It provides the Supabase `session` object, the `user` object, and the user's `profile` data (fetched from the `profiles` table). Components that need to know the current user's status, role, or identity consume this context.
    *   **`SessionContext`:** This context manages the collection of a user's practice sessions (`sessionHistory`). It is responsible for fetching the history and providing a function (`addSession`) to update the history in the application state after a new session is saved. This context is consumed by the `AnalyticsPage`.
    *   **`useSessionManager`:** This custom hook encapsulates the logic for saving, deleting, and exporting sessions. It interacts with the `lib/storage.js` module to perform the actual database operations and is used by components like `SessionPage`. After a successful save, it returns the new session object to the calling component, which is then responsible for adding it to the `SessionContext`.
*   **Routing:** Client-side routing is handled by `react-router-dom`.
*   **Logging:** The application uses `pino` for structured logging to improve debuggability and provide more consistent log output. For development, `pino-pretty` is used to format logs in a human-readable way. A shared logger instance is configured in `src/lib/logger.js` and is used throughout the frontend application to replace standard `console.log` statements.

### Memory Leak Prevention
Given the real-time nature of the application, proactive memory management is critical. Components involving continuous data streams (e.g., `useSpeechRecognition`, `TranscriptionService`) must be carefully audited for memory leaks. This includes:
*   **Proper Cleanup:** Ensuring all `useEffect` hooks have proper cleanup functions to unsubscribe from events and clear intervals.
*   **Memory Profiling:** Regularly using tools like the Chrome DevTools Performance and Memory tabs during extended testing sessions (soak tests) to identify and fix potential leaks before they impact users.

## 3. Backend Architecture

The backend is built entirely on the Supabase platform, leveraging its integrated services.

*   **Database:** A PostgreSQL database managed by Supabase. The schema is defined and managed through migration files located in `supabase/migrations`. The schema includes tables for users, sessions, transcripts, and usage tracking.
*   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth is used for user registration, login, and session management. It supports both email/password and OAuth providers.
*   **Serverless Functions:** Deno-based Edge Functions are used for secure, server-side logic.
    *   `assemblyai-token`: Securely generates temporary tokens for the AssemblyAI transcription service.
    *   `stripe-checkout`: Handles the creation of Stripe checkout sessions.
    *   `stripe-webhook`: Listens for and processes webhooks from Stripe to update user subscription status.
    *   `get-ai-suggestions`: (Future) Intended to provide AI-powered suggestions based on transcript analysis.

## 4. User Roles and Tiers

The application defines several user tiers that control access to features and usage limits. For a visual representation of the user journeys, see the [User Role Flows diagram in the PRD](./PRD.md#user-roles-&-flows). The user's tier is determined by their authentication state and their subscription status in Stripe, managed via Supabase.

*   **Anonymous User:**
    *   **Definition:** A user who has not signed in.
    *   **Flow:** Accesses the main landing page, can start a single practice session with a short, fixed duration (e.g., 2 minutes), and can view the analytics for that session. They are prompted to sign in to save history and unlock more features.
    *   **Transcription Mode:** Restricted to `NativeBrowser` only.

*   **Free User (Authenticated):**
    *   **Definition:** A user who has created an account and is logged in but does not have an active Pro subscription.
    *   **Flow:** Can view their session history. They have a limited amount of free practice time per month. When this limit is exhausted, they are prompted by the `UpgradePromptDialog` to upgrade to a Pro plan. Their session duration is also limited (e.g., 30 minutes).

*   **Pro User (Authenticated):**
    *   **Definition:** A user with an active, paid subscription via Stripe.
    *   **Flow:** Has unlimited practice time and no session duration limits. They have access to all current features and will have access to future premium features like on-device transcription.

*   **Premium User:**
    *   **Definition:** A user with an active premium subscription.
    *   **Flow:** Has all features of the Pro tier, plus exclusive access to:
        *   On-device (local) transcription via Transformers.js and Whisper WASM.
        *   Detailed analytics dashboards.
        *   The ability to download session data.

## 5. Transcription Service (`src/services/transcription`)
*(For leadership concerns on scalability and provider strategy, see [REVIEW.md â€“ Engineering perspective](./REVIEW.md)).*

The `TranscriptionService.js` provides a unified abstraction layer over multiple transcription providers. This allows the application to seamlessly switch between modes.

*   **Modes:**
    *   **`CloudAssemblyAI`:** Uses the AssemblyAI v3 streaming API for high-accuracy cloud-based transcription. This is the primary mode for Pro users.
    *   **`NativeBrowser`:** Uses the browser's built-in `SpeechRecognition` API. This is a cloud-based service with average STT accuracy. It is the primary mode for Free users and serves as a fallback for Pro users if `CloudAssemblyAI` is unavailable.
    *   **`LocalWhisper` (Future):** A planned on-device, privacy-first transcription mode for Premium users, using Transformers.js and a Whisper WASM model.
*   **Audio Processing:** The `audioUtils.js` and `audio-processor.worklet.js` are responsible for capturing microphone input, resampling it to the required 16kHz sample rate, and streaming it to the active transcription provider.

## 6. CI/CD

The project includes a basic CI/CD pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

*   **Current Implementation:** The workflow is triggered manually (`workflow_dispatch`) and handles the deployment of Supabase database migrations to a single environment.
*   **Future Work:** The pipeline needs to be expanded to support multiple environments (e.g., `staging`, `production`) and automated deployments based on branch pushes. See the [Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) for current status.

## 7. Testing Strategy
*(For leadership concerns on scalability and test debt, see [REVIEW.md â€“ Engineering perspective](./REVIEW.md)).*

This section outlines the official strategy for testing, debugging, and verification. It consolidates learnings from previous debugging sessions and establishes best practices for the project.

### 6.1. Component Testing Strategy

After a major effort to stabilize the test suite, the following strategy has been established to ensure tests are robust, isolated, and free from memory leaks.

*   **Core Problem:** The test suite previously suffered from a catastrophic memory leak originating from the Supabase `onAuthStateChange` listener. It also suffered from test pollution, where mocks in one file would affect tests in another.

*   **The Solution: Unified Test Renderer**
    A single, unified test utility, `renderWithAllProviders`, now exists in `src/test/test-utils.jsx`. This is the **required** way to render any component in a test file.

    ```javascript
    // Example usage in a test file
    import { render, screen } from '../../test/test-utils';
    import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';

    it('should render correctly', () => {
      render(<MyComponent />);
      expect(screen.getByText('Hello World')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
    ```

*   **What `renderWithAllProviders` Does:**
    1.  **Prevents Memory Leaks:** It automatically wraps all components in an `AuthProvider` with the `enableSubscription={false}` prop, which disables the leaky Supabase listener.
    2.  **Provides All Contexts:** It includes all essential global providers: `AuthProvider`, `SessionProvider`, `MemoryRouter` (from `react-router-dom`), and Stripe's `Elements` provider with a mock. This prevents "empty render" bugs caused by missing context.
    3.  **Enables Route Testing:** It allows passing a `route` option to simulate rendering a component on a specific URL or with specific route state, e.g., `render(<MyComponent />, { route: '/some/path' })`.

*   **Best Practices for Mocks:**
    1.  **Avoid Global Mocks:** Do not use top-level `vi.mock()` for libraries like `react-router-dom`. This was a primary source of test pollution. Use the `route` feature of the test helper instead.
    2.  **Isolate Mocks:** When mocking hooks or modules, do so within the test file that needs the mock.
    3.  **Clean Up:** Use `afterEach(() => { vi.restoreAllMocks(); });` in test files to ensure mocks do not leak between tests.

### 6.2. Strategy for Complex Hooks (e.g., `useSpeechRecognition`)

Complex hooks involving real-time browser APIs (e.g., `navigator.mediaDevices`, `WebSocket`) and asynchronous state are not suitable for unit testing in the `happy-dom` environment due to simulation limitations.

The established best practice is as follows:

1.  **Extract Pure Logic:** Any pure, stateless business logic (e.g., filler word counting, data transformation) must be extracted into standalone utility functions in `src/utils` and have 100% unit test coverage.
2.  **Debounce Expensive Operations:** For operations that run in response to frequent updates (like re-counting filler words on every transcript change), the hook uses a short debounce (e.g., 50ms). This prevents performance bottlenecks while maintaining a responsive feel for the UI.
3.  **Mock the Hook, Test the Component:** Components using a complex hook must be tested by mocking the *hook itself*. This allows for testing the component's rendering and behavior in various states (e.g., loading, error) without running the hook's internal logic.
4.  **Validate via E2E Tests:** The full functionality of the complex hook must be validated through End-to-End (E2E) tests using a real browser environment like Playwright. This is the only reliable method for testing features dependent on real hardware and network interactions.
5.  **Skip Unit Tests for the Hook:** The unit test file for the complex hook itself should contain a single, skipped test with a comment directing developers to the relevant E2E and component integration tests. This prevents the test suite from hanging while documenting the testing strategy.

### 6.3. General Best Practices & Troubleshooting

*   **Environment First:** The most common cause of test failure is a missing or misconfigured `.env` file. The app will render a "Configuration Needed" page, causing tests to fail. Always validate your environment first.
*   **Avoid `networkidle` in E2E Tests:** Third-party analytics and error-tracking scripts can enter aggressive retry loops, preventing the network from ever being truly "idle". In Playwright, prefer `wait_until="domcontentloaded"` and then wait for specific elements to become visible.
*   **Isolate Hanging Tests:** If a test file hangs, use `.skip` on all individual test cases. If it still hangs, the issue is in the module-level setup (e.g., `vi.mock` factory functions), not the test logic.
*   **Mocking:**
    *   Use `vi.spyOn` for simple global API mocks.
    *   Use mock factories (`createMock...`) in a `beforeEach` block for complex components.
    *   Never use fake timers (`vi.useFakeTimers`) with real async operations like `fetch`, as it will cause tests to hang.
