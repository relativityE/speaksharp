## Testing Strategy

The project's testing strategy emphasizes E2E and integration tests to ensure reliable user flows. This is supported by a robust, deterministic E2E testing environment orchestrated by Playwright.

### Failure and Logging Strategy

To ensure a robust and debuggable CI process, the testing scripts adhere to two core principles: failing loud and comprehensive logging.

**Failing Loud:**
All CI shell scripts (`ci-run-all.sh`, `vm-recovery.sh`, etc.) begin with `set -e`. This command ensures that if any step in the script fails, the script will exit immediately with a non-zero status code. This prevents the pipeline from continuing in an inconsistent or partially failed state.

**Comprehensive Logging:**
A multi-layered logging strategy is in place to capture artifacts from every stage of the test run:

| Log/Artifact | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Master Log** | `logs/ci-run-all.log` | A complete, time-stamped log of all steps, warnings, and errors from the `ci-run-all.sh` orchestrator script. The first place to look for an overview of a test run. |
| **JSON Metrics** | `test-results/metrics.json` | The final, aggregated JSON file containing detailed pass/fail counts, duration, and coverage data. This file is the source of truth for the SQM section in `PRD.md`. |
| **Build Log** | `logs/run-build.log` | Captures the full output of the `pnpm build` command, used for debugging bundling or minification errors. |
| **Playwright Report** | `playwright-report/` | An interactive HTML report generated by Playwright, containing detailed E2E test results, screenshots of failures, and execution traces. |
| **Vite Server Log** | `vite.log` | Captures the `stdout` and `stderr` from the Vite dev server during the E2E test run. Essential for debugging application-level errors that occur during tests. |

Core services and contexts (e.g., `TranscriptionService`, `AuthContext`) are tested implicitly through the hooks and components that use them. The individual modes of the `TranscriptionService` (e.g., `CloudAssemblyAI`) have dedicated unit tests. This approach prioritizes the testing of integrated functionality as it is experienced by the user.

### E2E Test Environment

The end-to-end (E2E) test environment is managed by Playwright's built-in `webServer` configuration, providing a streamlined and reliable setup.

1.  **Automated Server Management:** The `playwright.config.ts` file uses the `webServer` option to automatically manage the Vite development server.
    *   **Command:** It runs the `pnpm dev:foreground` script (`vite --mode test`) to start the server.
    *   **Health Check:** Playwright waits for the server to be fully available at the specified URL (`http://localhost:5173`) before starting any tests.
    *   **Cleanup:** The server process is automatically terminated by Playwright when the tests are finished.
    *   **Logging:** All `stdout` and `stderr` from the Vite server are piped directly into the test runner's output, making it easy to debug server-side issues during test runs.

2.  **Mock Service Worker (MSW) Integration:**
    *   **Problem:** E2E tests would hang due to a race condition where the test would attempt to interact with the application before the Mock Service Worker (MSW) was fully initialized.
    *   **Solution:** The test environment now exposes a `window.mswReady` promise that resolves only when MSW is active. A `beforeEach` hook in the E2E tests waits for this promise, guaranteeing the mock server is ready before any test interactions occur.

This modern approach eliminates the need for manual server management scripts (e.g., `global-setup.ts`, `global-teardown.ts`), resulting in a simpler, more robust, and easier-to-maintain testing environment.

### Test Stability and Memory Management

Recent investigations revealed significant stability issues with the unit test suite. The following architectural changes have been implemented to resolve them:

1.  **Unit Test Memory Leak Mitigation:**
    *   **Problem:** The Vitest suite suffered from a "JavaScript heap out of memory" error, caused by accumulating state and un-cleaned-up async operations in tests.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   The `vitest.config.mjs` has been configured to run tests in isolated forked processes (`pool: 'forks'`) and sequentially (`maxConcurrency: 1`) to prevent memory accumulation.
        *   Problematic tests (`LocalWhisper.test.ts`, `SessionSidebar.test.tsx`) have been refactored to use `vi.useFakeTimers()` and proper `afterEach` cleanup hooks to manage timers and unmount components correctly.

### Mocking Native Dependencies

Some features, like the on-device transcription powered by `LocalWhisper`, rely on libraries with native dependencies (e.g., `sharp` for image processing, `@xenova/transformers` for ML models). These native dependencies can be difficult to install and build in certain environments, especially in CI/CD pipelines or sandboxed test runners.

To solve this, we use a mocking strategy for the test environment:

1.  **Optional Dependency:** The native dependency (`sharp`) is listed as an `optionalDependency` in `package.json`. This prevents the package manager from failing the installation if the native build step fails.
2.  **Vitest Alias:** In `vitest.config.mjs`, we create aliases that redirect imports of `sharp` and `@xenova/transformers` to mock files.
3.  **Canvas-based Mock:** To improve stability, the mock for `sharp` (`src/test/mocks/sharp.ts`) now uses the `canvas` library, a pure JavaScript image processing tool with better stability in headless environments. The mock for `@xenova/transformers` provides a simplified, lightweight implementation for unit tests.
4.  **Dependency Inlining:** Because the `@xenova/transformers` import happens within a dependency, we must configure Vitest to process this dependency by adding it to `test.deps.inline`. This ensures the alias is applied correctly.

This approach allows us to use the high-performance native library in production while maintaining a stable and easy-to-manage test environment.

### Key Advantages of This Architecture

*   **Isolation:** The test server is isolated from any local development server.
*   **Deterministic:** Tests are only executed once the environment is confirmed to be ready, eliminating race conditions.
*   **Reliable Cleanup:** The teardown process ensures no zombie Vite processes are left running, even if tests crash or time out.
*   **CI-Friendly:** The architecture works identically on CI and locally, and it surfaces logs for easy debugging of failures.

### Lessons Learned: Debugging E2E Test Timeouts

During the development of the automated SQM reporting, we encountered a critical issue where the original monolithic test script would time out after ~7 minutes. This was a "silent failure" as the console output was lost, making it difficult to diagnose. The root cause was determined to be the CI environment's hard timeout limit, which was shorter than the time required for a full dependency install and test run.

Another key lesson was the importance of ensuring all necessary binaries are present. Early failures were caused by missing Playwright browser binaries.

**Solutions Implemented:**
- **Build System Migration for Compatibility:** The project was migrated from `@tailwindcss/vite` to a standard `postcss` setup.
  - **Problem:** The original `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin contained native binary dependencies that failed to build on `arm64` architectures (like Apple Silicon), blocking local development for some users.
  - **Solution:** Replaced the Vite-specific plugin with the standard `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, and `autoprefixer` packages. This required removing the plugin from `vite.config.mjs` and ensuring `postcss.config.cjs` was correctly configured to use the new dependencies. This change resolves the `arm64` compatibility issue.
- **Automated Browser Installation:** The `pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps` command is run as a dedicated step in `ci-run-all.sh` to ensure browsers are always installed. The `postinstall` script in `package.json` is used to initialize Mock Service Worker (`msw`), which is required for tests.
- **Architectural Refactoring:** To address the timeout, the testing process was re-architected into a multi-script workflow orchestrated by `ci-run-all.sh`, ensuring each step could complete within the timeout window.

### CI/CD Test Execution Workflow

The CI/CD pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and is designed to be simple, robust, and turn-key. It is orchestrated by GitHub Actions and triggers on any push or pull request to the `main` branch.

The pipeline consists of a single job, `build_and_test`, which performs all necessary checks to ensure code quality and application stability. This consolidated approach simplifies debugging and maintenance.

The job executes the following steps in order:
1.  **Checkout Repository**: Clones the repository code.
2.  **Setup PNPM & Node.js**: Configures the correct versions of the package manager and Node.js runtime.
3.  **Install Dependencies & Browsers**: Runs the `pnpm setup:dev` script, which installs all project dependencies and the required Playwright browsers.
4.  **Run Lint**: Executes `pnpm lint` to enforce code style.
5.  **Run Typecheck**: Runs `pnpm typecheck` to ensure type safety.
6.  **Run Unit Tests**: Executes the full unit test suite with `pnpm test:unit:full`.
7.  **Run E2E tests**: Runs the end-to-end test suite with `pnpm test:e2e`. Playwright's `webServer` configuration automatically starts the application, ensuring a reliable, self-contained test run.

### Containerized Test Environment

The proposed containerized test environment is not currently viable due to a lack of Docker daemon access in the CI environment. This is a known limitation and will be addressed in a future iteration.

### Agent Execution Environment

A significant portion of this project's CI/CD pipeline and initial development is managed by an AI software engineering agent. Understanding the agent's execution environment is critical for interpreting its actions and debugging issues related to its operation.

The environment has the following key characteristics:

*   **7-Minute Execution Limit:** Every task or command initiated by the agent is subject to a hard 7-minute execution timeout. This is a platform-level constraint that cannot be configured. Long-running processes, such as full dependency installations or comprehensive test suites, are likely to fail if they are not broken down into smaller, granular steps. This was the root cause of the initial CI instability.

*   **Tool-Triggered Git Commits:** Every action the agent takes using one of its tools (e.g., `read_file`, `run_in_bash_session`, `replace_with_git_merge_diff`) is automatically wrapped in a `git commit`. This has a significant side effect: it triggers `pre-commit` hooks. If the git hooks are broken or misconfigured (e.g., pointing to a non-existent `node_modules` directory), *every single tool call will fail*. This can create a deadlock where the agent cannot run `pnpm install` to fix the hooks because the command to do so fails. The `ci-run-all.sh` script was specifically designed with hook-disabling mechanisms to overcome this challenge.

*   **Available Tools:** The agent operates with a limited set of tools, including but not limited to:
    *   `ls`: List files.
    *   `read_file`: Read file content.
    *   `run_in_bash_session`: Execute shell commands.
    *   `create_file_with_block`, `overwrite_file_with_block`, `replace_with_git_merge_diff`: File manipulation tools.
    *   `set_plan`, `plan_step_complete`: Plan management.
    *   `message_user`, `request_user_input`: User interaction.
    *   `request_code_review`, `submit`: Code submission.

## 3. Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with React and Vite.

*   **Component Model:** The UI is built from a combination of page-level components (`src/pages`), feature-specific components (`src/components/session`, `src/components/landing`), and a reusable UI library (`src/components/ui`).
*   **Design System:** The UI components in `src/components/ui` are built using `class-variance-authority` (CVA) for a flexible, type-safe, and maintainable design system. Design tokens are managed in `tailwind.config.ts`.
*   **State Management:** Global state is managed via a combination of React Context and custom hooks.
    *   **`AuthContext`:** The primary source for authentication state. It provides the Supabase `session` object, the `user` object, and the user's `profile` data.
    *   **`SessionContext`:** Manages the collection of a user's practice sessions (`sessionHistory`).
    *   **`useSessionManager`:** A custom hook that encapsulates the logic for saving, deleting, and exporting sessions.
    *   **`useAnalytics`:** A custom hook that fetches and processes analytics data from the Supabase database.
*   **Routing:** Client-side routing is handled by `react-router-dom`, with protected routes implemented to secure sensitive user pages.
*   **Logging:** The application uses `pino` for structured logging.
*   **PDF Generation:** Session reports can be exported as PDF documents using the `jspdf` and `jspdf-autotable` libraries. The `pdfGenerator.ts` utility encapsulates the logic for creating these reports.
*   **Analytics Components:** The frontend includes several components for displaying analytics, such as `FillerWordTable`, `FillerWordTrend`, `SessionComparison`, `TopFillerWords`, and `AccuracyComparison`.
*   **AI-Powered Suggestions:** The `AISuggestions` component provides users with feedback on their speech.
*   **Image Processing:** The application uses `canvas` in the test environment for image processing tasks (replacing `Jimp` for stability), such as resizing user-uploaded images. The `processImage.ts` utility provides a convenient wrapper for this functionality.

### 3.1. Key Components

- **`SessionSidebar.tsx`**: This component serves as the main control panel for a user's practice session. It contains the start/stop controls, a digital timer, and the transcription mode selector.
  - **Mode Selector**: A segmented button group allows users to choose their desired transcription mode before starting a session. The options are:
    - **Cloud AI**: Utilizes the high-accuracy AssemblyAI cloud service.
    - **On-Device**: Uses a local Whisper model for privacy-focused transcription.
    - **Native**: Falls back to the browser's built-in speech recognition engine.
  - **Access Control**: Access to the "Cloud AI" and "On-Device" modes is restricted. These modes are enabled for users with a "pro" subscription status or for developers when the `VITE_DEV_USER` environment variable is set to `true`. Free users are restricted to the "Native" mode.

### Homepage Routing Logic
The application's homepage (`/`) has special routing logic to handle different user states. This logic is located directly within the `HomePage.tsx` component.
- **Production (`import.meta.env.DEV` is false):** Authenticated users who navigate to the homepage are automatically redirected to the main application interface (`/session`). This ensures they land on a functional page after logging in.
- **Development (`import.meta.env.DEV` is true):** The redirect is disabled. This allows developers to access and work on the public-facing homepage components even while being authenticated.

Given the real-time nature of the application, proactive memory management is critical. Components involving continuous data streams (e.g., `useSpeechRecognition`, `TranscriptionService`) must be carefully audited for memory leaks. This includes ensuring all `useEffect` hooks have proper cleanup functions.

## 4. Backend Architecture

The backend is built entirely on the Supabase platform, leveraging its integrated services.

*   **Database:** A PostgreSQL database managed by Supabase. Schema is managed via migration files in `supabase/migrations`.
*   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth is used for user registration, login, and session management.
*   **Serverless Functions:** Deno-based Edge Functions are used for secure, server-side logic.
    *   `assemblyai-token`: Securely generates temporary tokens for the AssemblyAI transcription service.
    *   `stripe-checkout`: Handles the creation of Stripe checkout sessions.
    *   `stripe-webhook`: Listens for and processes webhooks from Stripe to update user subscription status.

## 5. User Roles and Tiers

The application's user tiers have been consolidated into the following structure:

*   **Free User (Authenticated):** A user who has created an account but does not have an active Pro subscription. This is the entry-level tier for all users.
*   **Pro User (Authenticated):** A user with an active, paid subscription via Stripe. This tier includes all features, such as unlimited practice time, cloud-based AI transcription, and privacy-preserving on-device transcription.

## 6. Transcription Service (`src/services/transcription`)

The `TranscriptionService.ts` provides a unified abstraction layer over multiple transcription providers.

*   **Modes:**
    *   **`CloudAssemblyAI`:** Uses the AssemblyAI v3 streaming API for high-accuracy cloud-based transcription. This is one of the modes available to Pro users.
    *   **`NativeBrowser`:** Uses the browser's built-in `SpeechRecognition` API. This is the primary mode for Free users and a fallback for Pro users.
    *   **`LocalWhisper`:** An on-device, privacy-first transcription mode for Pro users, powered by `@xenova/transformers` running a Whisper model directly in the browser.
*   **Audio Processing:** `audioUtils.ts`, `audioUtils.impl.ts`, and `audio-processor.worklet.js` are responsible for capturing and resampling microphone input. A critical bug in the resampling logic that was degrading AI quality has been fixed.

### On-Device STT Implementation Details

The `LocalWhisper` provider uses the [`@xenova/transformers.js`](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js) library to run the `Xenova/whisper-tiny.en` model directly in the user's browser.

*   **How it Works (Hybrid Model Loading):**
    1.  **Primary Source (Hugging Face Hub):** The application first attempts to download the `Xenova/whisper-tiny.en` model directly from the Hugging Face Hub. This ensures users get the latest compatible version of the model without requiring an application update.
    2.  **Fallback Source (Local):** If the download from the Hub fails (due to network issues, a service outage, or restrictive firewalls), the system automatically falls back to loading a known-good version of the model hosted locally within the application at `/public/models/`. This hybrid approach maximizes availability and resilience.
    3.  **Caching:** Once loaded from either source, the model is cached in the browser's `CacheStorage`, making subsequent loads nearly instant.
    4.  **Inference Engine:** The library runs the model on a WebAssembly (WASM) version of the ONNX Runtime. This allows for near-native performance for model inference directly in the browser.
    5.  **Privacy:** All audio processing and transcription occurs entirely on the user's machine. No audio data is ever sent to a third-party server.

*   **Comparison to Cloud AI:**
    *   **Privacy:** On-device is 100% private. Cloud AI requires sending audio data to AssemblyAI's servers.
    *   **Accuracy:** Cloud AI is significantly more accurate as it uses a much larger model (`whisper-large-v3` equivalent). The on-device `whisper-tiny.en` model is less accurate but still highly effective for its size.
    *   **Performance:** On-device has a one-time initial download cost. After caching, it is very fast. Cloud AI has a constant network latency for streaming audio and receiving transcripts.
    *   **Cost:** On-device has no per-use cost. Cloud AI has a direct cost per minute of transcribed audio.
    *   **Availability:** On-device mode is highly available. It works offline after the initial model download (from either the Hub or the local fallback). A failure of the Hugging Face Hub will not prevent the feature from working, as the local fallback will be used.

### Speaker Identification

Speaker identification (or diarization) is handled by the AssemblyAI API. When the `speaker_labels` parameter is set to `true` in the transcription request, the API will return a `speaker` property for each utterance in the transcript. This allows the frontend to display who said what.

### STT Accuracy Comparison

The STT accuracy comparison feature calculates the Word Error Rate (WER) of each transcription engine against a "ground truth" transcript. The ground truth is a manually transcribed version of the audio that is stored in the `practice_sessions` table. The WER is then used to calculate an accuracy percentage, which is displayed in the analytics dashboard. This provides users with a clear understanding of how each STT engine performs.

## 7. CI/CD

The project includes a basic CI/CD pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for manual database deployments. This needs to be expanded to support multiple environments and automated deployments.
