## 2. Technology Stack

SpeakSharp is built on a modern, serverless technology stack designed for real-time applications.

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Framework:** React (v18) with Vite
    *   **Language:** TypeScript / JavaScript (JSX)
    *   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with a CVA-based design system
    *   **State Management:** React Context and custom hooks
*   **Backend (BaaS):**
    *   **Platform:** Supabase
    *   **Database:** Supabase Postgres
    *   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth
    *   **Serverless Functions:** Deno Edge Functions (for AssemblyAI token generation, Stripe integration, etc.)
*   **Third-Party Services:**
    *   **Cloud Transcription:** AssemblyAI (v3 Streaming API)
    *   **Payments:** Stripe
*   **Testing:**
    *   **Unit/Integration:** Vitest
    *   **E2E:** Playwright

## 2. Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with React and Vite.

*   **Component Model:** The UI is built from a combination of page-level components (`src/pages`), feature-specific components (`src/components/session`, `src/components/landing`), and a reusable UI library (`src/components/ui`).
*   **Design System:** The UI components in `src/components/ui` are built using `class-variance-authority` (CVA) for a flexible, type-safe, and maintainable design system. Design tokens are managed in `tailwind.config.ts`.
*   **State Management:** Global state is managed via a combination of React Context and custom hooks.
    *   **`AuthContext`:** The primary source for authentication state. It provides the Supabase `session` object, the `user` object, and the user's `profile` data.
    *   **`SessionContext`:** Manages the collection of a user's practice sessions (`sessionHistory`).
    *   **`useSessionManager`:** A custom hook that encapsulates the logic for saving, deleting, and exporting sessions. The anonymous user flow is now stable.
*   **Routing:** Client-side routing is handled by `react-router-dom`, with protected routes implemented to secure sensitive user pages.
*   **Logging:** The application uses `pino` for structured logging.

### Memory Leak Prevention
Given the real-time nature of the application, proactive memory management is critical. Components involving continuous data streams (e.g., `useSpeechRecognition`, `TranscriptionService`) must be carefully audited for memory leaks. This includes ensuring all `useEffect` hooks have proper cleanup functions.

## 3. Backend Architecture

The backend is built entirely on the Supabase platform, leveraging its integrated services.

*   **Database:** A PostgreSQL database managed by Supabase. Schema is managed via migration files in `supabase/migrations`.
*   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth is used for user registration, login, and session management.
*   **Serverless Functions:** Deno-based Edge Functions are used for secure, server-side logic.
    *   `assemblyai-token`: Securely generates temporary tokens for the AssemblyAI transcription service.
    *   `stripe-checkout`: Handles the creation of Stripe checkout sessions.
    *   `stripe-webhook`: Listens for and processes webhooks from Stripe to update user subscription status.

## 4. User Roles and Tiers

The application defines several user tiers that control access to features and usage limits.

*   **Anonymous User:** A user who has not signed in. The flow for this user is now functional.
*   **Free User (Authenticated):** A user who has created an account but does not have an active Pro subscription.
*   **Pro User (Authenticated):** A user with an active, paid subscription via Stripe.
*   **Premium User:** A user with an active premium subscription. This tier provides access to on-device, privacy-first transcription.

## 5. Transcription Service (`src/services/transcription`)

The `TranscriptionService.js` provides a unified abstraction layer over multiple transcription providers.

*   **Modes:**
    *   **`CloudAssemblyAI`:** Uses the AssemblyAI v3 streaming API for high-accuracy cloud-based transcription. This is the primary mode for Pro users.
    *   **`NativeBrowser`:** Uses the browser's built-in `SpeechRecognition` API. This is the primary mode for Free users and a fallback for Pro users.
    *   **`LocalWhisper`:** An on-device, privacy-first transcription mode for Premium users, powered by `@xenova/transformers` running a Whisper model directly in the browser.
*   **Audio Processing:** `audioUtils.js` and `audio-processor.worklet.js` are responsible for capturing and resampling microphone input. A critical bug in the resampling logic that was degrading AI quality has been fixed.

## 6. CI/CD

The project includes a basic CI/CD pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for manual database deployments. This needs to be expanded to support multiple environments and automated deployments.

## 7. Known Issues

*   All major technical debt related to the test suite has been resolved. The remaining tech debt is tracked in the [Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md).

## 8. Testing Frameworks & Implementation

This section describes the tools and technical practices used for testing. For the product-level testing strategy and quality goals, see the [Software Quality Metrics in the PRD](./PRD.md#5-software-quality-metrics).

### Required Practices
1.  **Use the Unified Test Helper:** All component tests **must** use the `renderWithAllProviders` function from `src/test/test-utils.jsx` to prevent memory leaks and ensure access to necessary contexts.
2.  **Mock Strategically:** For complex hooks like `useSpeechRecognition`, mock the hook itself to test the component's response to different states.
3.  **Clean Up Mocks:** All test files that use `vi.mock` or `vi.spyOn` should include an `afterEach(() => { vi.restoreAllMocks(); });` block.

### E2E Test Architecture
The E2E test architecture is now stable and follows best practices.

- **Network Stubbing (`tests/sdkStubs.ts`):** Uses `page.route()` to intercept outgoing network requests to third-party services and Supabase. This is done after navigating to `about:blank` to prevent race conditions with the application's startup.
- **Real Authentication Flow:** The tests now interact with the application like a real user. They fill out the login form on the `/auth` page, and the `sdkStubs.ts` file provides mock responses to the authentication API calls. This ensures the entire authentication flow is tested.
- **Media Device Mocking (`tests/mockMedia.ts`):** Uses an init script to replace `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` with a function that returns a fake audio stream, bypassing browser permission prompts.
