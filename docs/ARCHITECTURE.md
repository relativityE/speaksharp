## 2. Technology Stack

SpeakSharp is built on a modern, serverless technology stack designed for real-time applications.

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Framework:** React (v18) with Vite
    *   **Language:** TypeScript (TSX)
    *   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with a CVA-based design system
    *   **State Management:** React Context and custom hooks
*   **Backend (BaaS):**
    *   **Platform:** Supabase
    *   **Database:** Supabase Postgres
    *   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth
    *   **Serverless Functions:** Deno Edge Functions (for AssemblyAI token generation, Stripe integration, etc.)
*   **Third-Party Services:**
    *   **Cloud Transcription:** AssemblyAI (v3 Streaming API)
    *   **Payments:** Stripe
*   **Testing:**
    *   **Unit/Integration:** Vitest
    *   **E2E:** Playwright

## Testing Strategy

The project's testing strategy emphasizes E2E and integration tests to ensure reliable user flows. This is supported by a robust, deterministic E2E testing environment orchestrated by Playwright.

Core services and contexts (e.g., `TranscriptionService`, `AuthContext`) are tested implicitly through the hooks and components that use them. The individual modes of the `TranscriptionService` (e.g., `CloudAssemblyAI`) have dedicated unit tests. This approach prioritizes the testing of integrated functionality as it is experienced by the user.

### Test Environment Overview

The test configuration creates a controlled environment with the following flow:
1.  **Playwright Test Start:** The test runner (`pnpm playwright test`) first invokes `global-setup.ts`.
2.  **Vite Server Launch (`global-setup.ts`):**
    *   Spawns the Vite dev server in a detached process group (`--mode test --host`).
    *   Captures all `stdout` and `stderr` from the Vite process into a `vite.log` file for debugging.
    *   Parses the Vite logs to **dynamically detect the port** the server is running on, avoiding hardcoded port conflicts.
    *   Performs a **robust health check** by polling the detected URL until it returns a `200 OK` status, ensuring the application is fully ready before any tests begin.
3.  **E2E Test Execution:** Once the health check passes, Playwright proceeds to run the test suites (e.g., `basic.e2e.spec.ts`).
4.  **Teardown & Cleanup (`global-teardown.ts`):** After all tests complete, Playwright invokes `global-teardown.ts`.
    *   It safely kills the entire Vite process group, first with a graceful `SIGTERM` and then with a `SIGKILL` if necessary, preventing zombie processes.
    *   It cleans up the `.vite.pid` file.
    *   For debugging purposes, it prints the last 20 lines of `vite.log` to the console.

### Core Artifacts

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `vite.config.mjs` | Vite dev server configuration, including test-specific aliases. |
| `.env.test` | Environment variables for the test environment. |
| `tests/global-setup.ts` | Starts the Vite server and waits for it to be fully ready. |
| `tests/global-teardown.ts` | Safely stops the Vite server and provides diagnostic logs. |
| `playwright.config.ts` | Configures Playwright projects, including the smoke test, and hooks in the global setup/teardown scripts. |
| `vite.log` | Captures all output from the Vite server during a test run. |
| `.vite.pid` | Stores the Process ID of the running Vite server for teardown. |
| `tests/e2e/basic.e2e.spec.ts` | A baseline smoke test that validates the environment's stability. |

### Key Advantages of This Architecture

*   **Isolation:** The test server is isolated from any local development server.
*   **Deterministic:** Tests are only executed once the environment is confirmed to be ready, eliminating race conditions.
*   **Reliable Cleanup:** The teardown process ensures no zombie Vite processes are left running, even if tests crash or time out.
*   **CI-Friendly:** The architecture works identically on CI and locally, and it surfaces logs for easy debugging of failures.

## 3. Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with React and Vite.

*   **Component Model:** The UI is built from a combination of page-level components (`src/pages`), feature-specific components (`src/components/session`, `src/components/landing`), and a reusable UI library (`src/components/ui`).
*   **Design System:** The UI components in `src/components/ui` are built using `class-variance-authority` (CVA) for a flexible, type-safe, and maintainable design system. Design tokens are managed in `tailwind.config.ts`.
*   **State Management:** Global state is managed via a combination of React Context and custom hooks.
    *   **`AuthContext`:** The primary source for authentication state. It provides the Supabase `session` object, the `user` object, and the user's `profile` data.
    *   **`SessionContext`:** Manages the collection of a user's practice sessions (`sessionHistory`).
    *   **`useSessionManager`:** A custom hook that encapsulates the logic for saving, deleting, and exporting sessions. The anonymous user flow is now stable.
*   **Routing:** Client-side routing is handled by `react-router-dom`, with protected routes implemented to secure sensitive user pages.
*   **Logging:** The application uses `pino` for structured logging.

### Memory Leak Prevention
Given the real-time nature of the application, proactive memory management is critical. Components involving continuous data streams (e.g., `useSpeechRecognition`, `TranscriptionService`) must be carefully audited for memory leaks. This includes ensuring all `useEffect` hooks have proper cleanup functions.

## 4. Backend Architecture

The backend is built entirely on the Supabase platform, leveraging its integrated services.

*   **Database:** A PostgreSQL database managed by Supabase. Schema is managed via migration files in `supabase/migrations`.
*   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth is used for user registration, login, and session management.
*   **Serverless Functions:** Deno-based Edge Functions are used for secure, server-side logic.
    *   `assemblyai-token`: Securely generates temporary tokens for the AssemblyAI transcription service.
    *   `stripe-checkout`: Handles the creation of Stripe checkout sessions.
    *   `stripe-webhook`: Listens for and processes webhooks from Stripe to update user subscription status.

## 5. User Roles and Tiers

The application's user tiers have been consolidated into the following structure:

*   **Anonymous User:** A user who has not signed in.
*   **Free User (Authenticated):** A user who has created an account but does not have an active Pro subscription.
*   **Pro User (Authenticated):** A user with an active, paid subscription via Stripe. This tier includes all features, such as unlimited practice time, cloud-based AI transcription, and privacy-preserving on-device transcription.

## 6. Transcription Service (`src/services/transcription`)

The `TranscriptionService.ts` provides a unified abstraction layer over multiple transcription providers.

*   **Modes:**
    *   **`CloudAssemblyAI`:** Uses the AssemblyAI v3 streaming API for high-accuracy cloud-based transcription. This is one of the modes available to Pro users.
    *   **`NativeBrowser`:** Uses the browser's built-in `SpeechRecognition` API. This is the primary mode for Free users and a fallback for Pro users.
    *   **`LocalWhisper`:** An on-device, privacy-first transcription mode for Pro users, powered by `@xenova/transformers` running a Whisper model directly in the browser.
*   **Audio Processing:** `audioUtils.ts`, `audioUtils.impl.ts`, and `audio-processor.worklet.js` are responsible for capturing and resampling microphone input. A critical bug in the resampling logic that was degrading AI quality has been fixed.

### On-Device STT Implementation Details

The `LocalWhisper` provider uses the [`@xenova/transformers.js`](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js) library to run the `Xenova/whisper-tiny.en` model directly in the user's browser.

*   **How it Works (Hybrid Model Loading):**
    1.  **Primary Source (Hugging Face Hub):** The application first attempts to download the `Xenova/whisper-tiny.en` model directly from the Hugging Face Hub. This ensures users get the latest compatible version of the model without requiring an application update.
    2.  **Fallback Source (Local):** If the download from the Hub fails (due to network issues, a service outage, or restrictive firewalls), the system automatically falls back to loading a known-good version of the model hosted locally within the application at `/public/models/`. This hybrid approach maximizes availability and resilience.
    3.  **Caching:** Once loaded from either source, the model is cached in the browser's `CacheStorage`, making subsequent loads nearly instant.
    4.  **Inference Engine:** The library runs the model on a WebAssembly (WASM) version of the ONNX Runtime. This allows for near-native performance for model inference directly in the browser.
    5.  **Privacy:** All audio processing and transcription occurs entirely on the user's machine. No audio data is ever sent to a third-party server.

*   **Comparison to Cloud AI:**
    *   **Privacy:** On-device is 100% private. Cloud AI requires sending audio data to AssemblyAI's servers.
    *   **Accuracy:** Cloud AI is significantly more accurate as it uses a much larger model (`whisper-large-v3` equivalent). The on-device `whisper-tiny.en` model is less accurate but still highly effective for its size.
    *   **Performance:** On-device has a one-time initial download cost. After caching, it is very fast. Cloud AI has a constant network latency for streaming audio and receiving transcripts.
    *   **Cost:** On-device has no per-use cost. Cloud AI has a direct cost per minute of transcribed audio.
    *   **Availability:** On-device mode is highly available. It works offline after the initial model download (from either the Hub or the local fallback). A failure of the Hugging Face Hub will not prevent the feature from working, as the local fallback will be used.

## 7. CI/CD

The project includes a basic CI/CD pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for manual database deployments. This needs to be expanded to support multiple environments and automated deployments.
