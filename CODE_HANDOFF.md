# Code Handoff

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-12

This document summarizes the current state of the project for the next developer or AI agent.

## 1. Completed Tasks

*   **Restored Critical Files:** The 11 critical files from the original `REBOOT_HANDOFF.md` were verified to be in their correct, fixed state. No restoration was necessary.
*   **Installed Dependencies:** All project and Playwright dependencies were successfully installed.
*   **Diagnosed E2E Test Hang:** The root cause of the E2E test hangs was identified as a silent crash in the Vite dev server, caused by an incorrect Tailwind CSS configuration.
*   **Fixed Tailwind CSS Bug:** The Tailwind CSS bug was fixed by updating `src/index.css` to use the modern `@import "tailwindcss";` syntax.
*   **Implemented Global Test Watchdog:** A robust Playwright global setup was created in `tests/global-setup.ts` to provide fast-failing tests with artifact capture (screenshots and HTML) on timeout. This will prevent silent hangs in the future.
*   **Documented Debugging Process:** The process for debugging the E2E test hangs has been documented in `docs/ROADMAP.md` under the "Technical Debt" section.

## 2. Current Task

I am currently in the process of debugging the `free.e2e.spec.ts` test. Now that the environment issues are resolved, the test is failing due to an application-level or test-level bug.

*   **Current Status:** The `free.e2e.spec.ts` test fails because it cannot find the 'Email' input field on the `/auth` page.
*   **Next Step:** The immediate next step is to analyze the HTML of the `/auth` page at the time of the test failure to determine why the element is not being found. I have already captured the logs and HTML content for this purpose.

## 3. Assigned Tasks

The following tasks are assigned to be worked on:

1.  **Fix the `free.e2e.spec.ts` test:** Debug and fix the "element not found" error for the email input field.
2.  **Verify all E2E tests:** Once the `free` test is passing, run the `anon` and `pro` tests to ensure they also pass.
3.  **Complete the pre-submission checklist:**
    *   Run the final validation script (`./run-tests.sh`) after receiving user approval.
    *   Review all documentation to ensure it is synchronized with the final state of the code.
4.  **Submit the code for review.**

## 4. Insights for the Next Developer

*   **The environment is still somewhat unstable.** The `run_in_bash_session` tool has been timing out intermittently, even for simple commands. Be prepared for this and use alternative tools like `read_file` when possible.
*   **The new global test watchdog is a powerful tool.** If tests hang, check the `test-results/e2e-artifacts/` directory for screenshots and HTML files that will help you debug the issue.
*   **The user is very hands-on and provides excellent guidance.** Pay close attention to their messages, as they often contain valuable insights and specific instructions.
*   **The documentation in `/docs` is the single source of truth.** Always consult `docs/OUTLINE.md` to understand where to find or add information.
